 Je viens d�hériter d�une somme importante d�argent et je ne m�y connais pas en transfert international ni en placement. J�ai donc besoin de vous pour m�aider à transférer et à gérer cette fortune.
 Mon défunt père Foday Sabanah Sankoh fut chef des rebelles du (R. U. F.)
 il contrôlait toute la zone diamantifère de la Sierra Léone. Avant sa mort le 29 Juillet dernier
 il fut arrêté
 emprisonné et condamné par le gouvernement de mon pays.
 Mon père a eu l�idée ingénieuse de déposer en mon nom dans une société de sécurité et de gardiennage en République du Bénin ( Afrique de l�Ouest ) du nom de SOBECI SARL la somme d�argent de 50 millions de dollar américain. Le dépôt a été fait depuis 4 ans. Tous les documents originaux concernant ce dépôt sont en ma possession.
 Je voudrais que vous m�apportiez l�assistance nécessaire pour pouvoir récupérer ces fonds et les transférer hors de l�Afrique.

I know this proposal letter may come to you as a surprise considering the fact that we have not had any formal acquaintance before
but all the same I would want you for the sake of God to give this an immediate attention in view of the fact that the security of our live and possession is at stake.
 I am Fatou Mohammed  a 24 years old  girl from war ravaged SIERRA LEONE but presently domiciled in Abidjan  Ivory coast with my brother Hassan  who is 16 years old.My father Alhaji Ibrahim Mohammed  who before his untimely assassination by the rebels was the Director of SIERRA LEONE Diamond corporation (SLDC).He was killed in our government residential house along side two of my other brothers

 younger sister and mother
we were on a week end visit to our home town As we got the news of the tragedy. We immediately managed to ran into neighbouring Ivory coast for refuge.
 But unfortunately. As Fate would have it
we lost our dear mother (may soul rest in peace) as a result of what the Doctor called cardiac arrest.
 As we were coming into this country 
we had some documents of a deposit of $ 28
500.000 USD (Twenty Eight million Five hundred thousand USD ) made by my late father in a security and trust company.According to my father
 he intended to use this fund for his international business transaction after his tenure in office but was unfortunately murdered.
 We had located the security company where the money is deposited with the help of an attorney and established ownership.please right now
with the bitter experiences we had in our country and the war still going on especially in diamond area which incidentally is where we hail from .coupled with the incessant political upheavals and hostilities in this country  Ivory coast
we desire seriously to leave here and live the rest of our life into a more peaceful and politically stable country like yours Hence this proposal and request.
 We therefore wish you can help us in the following regards :
 1)To provide us with a good bank account to transfer the money into 
 2)To help us invest the money into a lucrative business .
 3) To assist my brother get a college admission to further her education.

 this money is still with the Security Firm.(Name of the security company withheld now for personal reasons)

   The political stuations here in Africa did not give any encauragement for investors or investments.

17 Copse Hill
Baghdad
 Iraq
 My Dear Beloved

      Let me start by introducing myself. I am  Mr. Maekal Mekha
 a Baghdad Citizen
 Iraq
 a Mechant as an occupation. I have a obscured business suggestion for you. I am a brother to Dr.Gerald Mekha
who worked with 
 Iraq Judicial Commission 
 Iraq
 for over a decade before he died on 20th of March in the year 2007.
 He died after a brief  illness that lasted for two weeks. Before his death he made a vow to use his wealth for the down trodden and the less privileged in the society. When my brother was alive he deposited the sum of £250 Million Pounds (Two Hundred and Fifty Million Pounds) with one United Kingdom Security Company in London.
 This funds are still with the Security Company for the past 6 years now
the funds are locked in two metallic trunk boxes
 deposited with these company
 i am in a refugee camp here in Iraq
 as a result of the war in 
 Iraq this moment
 am sorry am not too fine based on my health
though what disturbs me most is my stroke. 
 "Having known my condition and want to make sure i do my fathers will
 I have decided to donate this fund to an individual or company
that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein. "
 "I want an individual or company that will use this to fund and provide succor to poor and indigent persons
 orphanages
 and widows and for propagating peace in the universe. I understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I do not have any one that will inherit this money and my staying in the refugee camp
 still dont know when ill be granted the visa permit out of Iraq. I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner
 hence the reason for taking this bold decision."
 I do not need any telephone communication in this regard because of my uneasy access to the facility in the refugee camp here in Iraq. Also because of the presence of social security in the camp
 I do not want them to know. With Allah all things are possible.
  As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact information of the Security Company in London
United Kingdom. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will empower you as the original beneficiary of this fund. I want you to always pray for me.
 My happiness is that I lived a life worthy of emulation. Whosoever that wants to serve the Almighty Allah must serve him with all his heart and mind and soul and also in truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for an individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act according to my specification herein. 
 Hoping to hear from you. Thank you and may the Almighty Allah bless you.
 Kindly send your email message to my mailbox :  mekha_llcs@yahoo.dk  
 so i can contact you with more information 
 Yours sincerely

 Mr. Maekal Mekha
