 we
 sent a reminder and finally
 we discovered from his employers that he died from an automobile accident. On further
 investigation
 we found out from his account file that he never made a will and all attempts to trace his next of kin was
 fruitless
 as he had none. We therefore made further investigations and discovered that Mr. Travis Myers did not

 Mr.Dayo Naps

Greetings to you

 With warm heart I offer my friendship
 and I hope this mail meets you in good time. However strange or surprising this letter might seem to you as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past
 I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. Also I duly apologize for infringing on your privacy
 if this contact is not acceptable to you
 as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity.
 First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi
 I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi
 leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct
 I selected your email address from an internet directory
 in my search for a partner
 hence this email. I also crave your indulgence to read this carefully
 and have a general overview of my situation. 
 "My Uncle (Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola
 led by President Dos Santos
 on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death
 Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command
 assumed office as leader of UNITA
 due to the lack of Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo
 there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions
 including Mr.Dembo
 planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncles death. As I already lost my mentor in this struggle that has been on for three decades now
 not so much of the struggle interested me anymore
 as there was no more sense of direction. I then desired a peaceful life
 as I no more had interest in conflicts and wars. For this reason
 I secretly left Angola and came here (Holla!"
 seek for political asylum.
 "I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your most needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncles money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million)
 which was already on its way to my Uncles Swiss Bank account
 through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad
 and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam
 Holland in February last year when the tragic incident of my Uncles death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited all this time now for security reasons
 and have now decided to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact
 the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit with the Security Company here in Amsterdam. "
 "President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncles assets and accounts abroad
 to ground UNITA
 and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds to the government here."
 I plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to place in you is extraordinary
 and an act of desperation on my part
 in order not to lose this money. Also
 ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy.
 Your role in this project
 is acting on my behalf as a trustee to claim the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name
 from the Security company
 after which
 the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted
 and I have permission to do business and open an account here. 
 I have with me
 the Certificate of Deposit for the safety deposit
 which is in my name
 and will be used for claim from the security company
 and the release codes of the vaults. Also
 everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you
 and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response.
 I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal. 
 Please contact me on my private email address; olivsav@netscape.net  whether or not you are interested in assisting us. This will enable us make alternative plans
 in the event of non-interest on your part.

I am sorry for the embarrassment this letter might cause you as we have not had any correspondence before this letter. I got your address through my nephew   with Nigerian Military Chamber of Commerce industry and Mining during my research for a reliable and trustworthy partner who l can do business with though l did not disclose the nature of the business l intend to do with whoever he recommend for me.
 I am DR. MRS MARIAM ABACHA
 wife of the late Nigeria Head of State
 General Sanni Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998 while still on active duty. I am contacting you in view of the fact that we will be of great assistance to each other likeness developing a cordial relationship.
 I currently have within my reach the sum of Twenty - Five Million US Dollars (US$25
000
000.00) cash which l intends to use for investment
 like Real Estate Development specifically in your country. This money came as a payback contract deal between my late husband and a Russian Firm on our countries Multi-billion dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant.
 "The Russian Partners returned my husbands Share of USD$25
000
000.00 after the death of my husband and Lodged in my husbands Security Company of which l am director right now
 the new Civilian Government have intensified their probe on my husband? Financial and oil company. In view of these
 l acted fast to withdraw the US$25
000
000.00 from the company vault and deposited it in a Security Company. I have since declared the Security Company bankrupt. No record ever existed concerning the money traceable by the government because there is no documentation showing that we received the money from the Russian."
 Due to the current situation in the country concerning government attitude towards my family
 it has become quite impossible for me to make use of this money within. Let me refer you to the front page of this day newspapers of 10th March 2001. You can check it through their website www.thisdayonline.com the present government in Nigeria had frozen and seized all our bank accounts both here in Nigeria and abroad.Thus consent l shall expect you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss in detail about this transaction.Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to transfer this fund
 I proposed a percentage of 30% of the total sum to you for the expected service and assistance
 15% for offsetting minor expenses incurred in the  course of this transaction. Your urgent response is highly needed as to stop further contacts. All correspondence must be by the email address mariamabacha200@ecplaza.net I will give you my Tel numbers where you can contact me when I hear from you.

 Please for more confidentiality of this transaction
 i hereby advise that you should kindly reply me through this mail address that is more secured (great_investment@omaninfo.com).
 May I crave your indulgence to open this business discussion by a formal letter of this sort. It is pertinent that a business of this magnitude should have commenced properly with a formal meeting of you and us to enable us know ourselves
 have a fore knowledge of the nature of the business
 discuss and acquaint ourselves with the responsibilities and functions of parties concerned
 and appropriate shares accordingly. However
 for time factor
 confidentiality and personality of people involved here in Nigeria
 we choose this approach for the remittance of this Fourty Five Million U.S. Dollars (US$45M). Please bear with us for making the initial contact through e-mail. But my partners are insisting for a meeting in order not to fall into a wrong hand again. 
 I am Dr Ali Mohammed
we are members of the special committee for Budget and Planning of the Ministry Petroleum. This committee is principally concerned with contract appraisal and the approval of the contracts in order of priorities as regards capital projects of the past military government of Nigeria.
 With our positions
 we have successfully secured for ourselves this sum of Fourty Five Million U.S. Dollars (US$45M). This amount was accumulated through undeclared windfall sales of crude oil during the gulf war.
 Hence together with two of our top officials at the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC)
 we plan to transfer this amount of money into a secure overseas account by awarding a sort of contract from the NNPC. To this effect I have been given the mandate by my colleagues to contact you and ask for your assistance. What we need from you is to provide a nice account in which the funds will be transferred. My colleagues and I have agreed to compensate you or the owner of the account used for this transaction with 30% of the total amount remitted. We shall have 65% and the remaining 5% reserved for taxes and other miscellaneous expenses in your country. 
 It may interest you to know that last two years a similar transaction was carried out with one Mr. Patrice Miller
 the President of Craine International Trading Corporation at number 135 East 57th Street
 28th Floor
 New York
 NY 10022 with telephone number (212) 308-7788 and telex number 6731689. After the agreement between both partners in which he was to take 20% of the money while the remaining 80% for us. 
 With all the required documents signed
 the money was duly transferred into this account only to be disappointed on our arrival in New York
 and we were reliably informed that Mr. Patrice Miller was no longer on that address while his telephone and telex numbers have been reallocated to somebody else. 
 That was how we lost US$9 Million to Mr. Patrice Miller.
 This time around we need a more reliable and trustworthy person or a reputable company to do business with hence this letter to you. So if you can prove yourself to be trusted and interested in this deal then we are prepared to do business with you. What we want from you is the assurance that you will let us have our share if this amount (US$45M) is transferred into your account. If this proposal is okay by you
 then reply through my email urgently so that we can set the ball rolling and negotiate the modalities involved.
 Kindly
 treat as very important and strictly confidential
 I honestly assure you that this transaction is 100% risk-free. I look forward to your response and expected co-operation and God bless you.
 Regards

 Dr Ali Mohammed.

HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL.
 I decided to contact you by email because I feel that it is more secured and private. I am Nasser Bin Nasiri
 Director of Procurement and Contract Award with
 Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources [MPMR]. I am contacting you concerning the transfer of US$43 Million Dollars (FOURTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS)
 Sometime ago
 a contract was awarded by my Corporation
 [MPMR] to a Japanese Firm
 to carry out Turn Around Maintenance and rehabilitation work on Emirates Petroleum Products Company (EPPCO) This contract was over invoiced by us to the tune of US$43. Million {Forty Three Million United States Dollars).  Myself and my partner reached a compromise to transfer the
 fund into a Foreign bank account that will accommodate
 this fund. We have all modalities set.
 We were disappointed last time by a US Senator
 Late Paul Wellstone whom we trusted with a transaction of this nature up to the tune of $45 Million USD in 2001. They sat on our money for no apparent reason and was still holding our money until his family were killed in a plane crash last December.   We still believe
 that good people still exist in this world and we are willing to try again with you
 bearing in mind that God will all way fight for us.
 You can confirm the above transaction from Mr. Clarence Barnes
 Uncle to the Senator
 who provided the receiving bank account.  His email address is cbarnes@worldemail.com and phone 1-661-310-2112.   He is enjoying our collective money and refused to give us our share but we believe
 he shall meet his doom as Senator did.  Because of this we are afraid and we need your total trust and assurance that you must be an honest and straight forward person.  We made a costly mistake with the Senator
 by not going into agreement.
 Based on our status as senior government officials in top sensitive position of trust
 we cannot stand to claim this money ourselves without the assistance of a foreigner.  The process will not require your presence here in UAE.  I guarantee that this transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.
 We intend to share the money in the following manner: 30% for you
 60% for us and 10% will be for any expenses incured during the transfer.  Contact me immediately if you are interested for further details.  We look forward to a fruitful business relationship with you and your urgent response.
 Best Regards

REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS ASSISTANCE
 After due deliberation with my children
 I decided to contact you for your assistance in standing as a beneficiary to the sum of US30.5M Thirty Million
 Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only)
 THE PROPOSAL
 This fund emanated as a result of an over-invoiced contract which he executed with the Government of South Africa. Though I assisted him in getting this contract but I never knew that it was over-invoiced by him. I am afraid that the government of South Africa might start to investigate on contracts awarded from 1990 to date.If they discover this money in his bank account
 they will confiscate it and seize his assets here in South Africa and this will definetely affect my political career in Government.
 SHARING PERCENTAGE
 Thanks for your anticipated co-operation and my regards to your family.
 Yours faithfully

 I know you will be surprised to hear from me
 but please consider this as a request from family in dire need of assistance.I am Mrs.Monica Yangani
 writing to you from Government Reserved Area (GRA).I got your contact information from the Republic of Congo Chamber of Commerce and Industry. When I was searching for a reliable individual or private company that can assist me to transfer a reasonable amount in a safe account abroad on behalf of my late husband
 two sons and two daughters. I decided to solicit your assistance to transfer this sum of US $20 Million (Twenty Million
 United States Dollars)inherited from my late husband in to your personal company’s account or private account.Before his death
 he was a Brigadier in charge of arms and ammunition procurement for the (DRC) army. In his WILL?he specifically draws my attention to this US$ 20 Million which he deposited in a safe box in Private Security Company in South Africa. \xa0During the war
 he was very dedicated and committed to winning the war against the rebels until when he found out that some Senior Army Officers and Government Functionaries were busy helping themselves with government funds and properties and sending them toforeign countries. Due to this
 he and his former special advisers to the president were assigned by the President (Laurent Kabila) to purchase arms in South Africa
 they saw this as a golden opportunity and diverted the money and divided it and he got a total sum of US $20 Million. He deposited the box in my son’s name and him alone with the deposit code canclaim it.
 Further information and arrangement will commence as soon as trust
 confidence and good relationship will be established and safety of this fund assured when transferred to your account.Please treat this matter with utmost urgency.May Allah (God) bless you as I earnestly hope for your
 assistance.

 I wish to begin by way of introduction. I am William Mabaye the first and only surviving son of late Tutu Mabaye one of the foremost and rich black farmers in Zimbabwe recently murdered in the land dispute in my country. Before the death of my father
 he had taken me to Johannesburg-South Africa
 to deposit the sum of US$25 million (Tweenty Five Million United States Dollars) in one of the private security companies
 as family valuables
 when he realized the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals for the farms and also for the establishment of new farms in Swaziland.
 This land dispute started when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land reform
 which was particularly targeted at the rich white farmers and a few black farmers (my father included). This resulted in the gruesome killing of rich farmers (mainly whites) and the unlawful possession of their properties by Mugabe?s war veterans
 under the disguise of fighting for the interest of the country.
  It is against this background that I fled the country with my family
 to the Netherlands where we are currently seeking asylum.
 I have decided to seek foreign assistance
 as the Netherlands law prohibits asylum seekers from operating bank accounts or involve in financial transaction of any kind
 hence this letter to you. All I need is your trustworthiness to be able to entrust the above said amount and help me with investment opportunities. My family?s survival depends on this money as we have virtually lost all our assets.
 There are two options
 firstly
 you can choose to accept 25% of the total amount for your assistance or go into partnership for the proper investment of the money in your country. We shall discuss in detail the modalities involved when you reply providing me with your telephone &amp; fax numbers. 
 I await your reply through the  above email 
while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required to ensure a safe and hitch free transaction.I shall furnish you with more details on request.
 Yours truly
 William Mabaye

 Local Bank here in Nigeria. On a routine inspection I discovered a dormant
 Domiciliary account with a Balance of $26
000
000 USD (Twenty Six Million USD) on 
 further discreet investigation
 I also discovered that the account
 holder has long passed away (dead) leaving no beneficiary to the account. 
 The bank will approve this money to any foreigner because the former operator of
 The account is a foreigner
 He died in a car accident nine years ago
 nobody else knows 
 about these funds
 and only a foreigner with the legal documents of the account can claim 
 this money
 so that’s why I need your cooperation in this transaction.
 I will provide the necessary information needed in order to claim this money
 But you 
 will need to provide an account where this money can be transferred. 
 I wish for utmost confidentiality in handling this transaction as my job and the future
 of my family would be jeopardized if it were breached.
 I want to assure you that the transaction is without risk if due process is followed 
 accordingly. Finally
 I will give you 25% for your corporation and efforts.
 If interested and capable to assist me in this transaction
 please get back to me 
 immediately.
 I look forward to a favorable response from you through the contacts below.

My name is Paul Jacksoncole
 I am a consulting auditor with one of the prime banks here in South Africa. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my client bank who perished with his whole families on 25TH JULY
2000 in 
 CONCORDE PLANE CRASH [Flight AF4590] with the whole passengers on board. 
 "During the course of my auditing work with my client bank
 I discovered an account opened in the bank in 1998 by this great late INDUSTRIALIST who died without a written or oral WILL attached to the account. Since his death
 I "
 further investigated with keen interest to see if i can get any relative of the late industrialist but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds and no other person knows about this account or anything concerning it
 the account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the CEO of his company. 
 The total amount involved is $36
000
000.00 USD.[Thirty Six Million United States Dollar]. We wish to start the first transfer with $10
000
000.00[Ten million] and upon successful transaction without any disappointment from your 
 side
 we shall re-apply for the transfer of the remaining balance to your account.I have secretly discussed this matter with a close confidant attorney whom I must involve in order to assist us produce legal back-up documents which 
 would substantiate your claims and also enable us have a smooth and successful transfer of the fund to any foreign bank account which you are going to nominate. 
 On this note
 I decided to seek for a reliable foreigner who will act as the foreign beneficiary of the fund from the deceased by providing his/her bank account where the fund will be transferred. The banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than six years without claim hence the money will be recalled to the government treasury 
 as unclaimed after this long period of dormancy. In view of this I got your contact through my personal search to see if you can assist by providing your safe bank account for the transfer or find a reliable person who will be capable of 
 receiving such amount in his or her personal account. At the conclusion of the transfer 65% of the fund will be for me
 I will give you 20% of the total transfer sum
 10% for charity both in Africa and in your country while the remaining 5% will 
 be set aside to settle expenses both parties might incure during the transfer process. 
 Upon the receipt of your reply
 I will send to you a detailed information about the transaction. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is 100% risk and trouble free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund 
 transfer can be finalized within 7 to 9 banking days
 after you apply to the bank as the beneficiary of the fund from the deceased. When you receive this letter. 
 I look forward to your earliest reply through my private email address &lt;mailto:mrp_jack@myway.com or pauljacksoncole@yahoo.com&gt; and telephone number +874 763 593 620. Fax number +874 763 593 621.Just add your international dial out code number and you will get through.You should also include your private fax and phone numbers for easy and safe communication.

from the republic of Sierra-Leone in west Africa
now seeking political asylum in Senegal under the (UNHCR).I got your contact through my search for a business partner.
 "In Details.My late father (Dr.MUSTAPHA BAMOGU) was the managing director of Rainbow Gold Diamond Mining company in (KEN EMA) Sierra- Leone.But was killed during the longing civil war and all his properties was totally destroyed.However

we only want this done this way because your country is politically stable for any profitable investment and if you accept our proposal
you will serve as the beneficiary of the diamonds.

we shall mapped out 2% for any miscellaneous expenses that you may incur during the transferring of the diamonds over to your country. Finally
the diamond weight in question is 14.550 Carats.Conclusively

 Attention:The President/CEO.
 I am barrister David Clovis (Esq.)
 an English speaking Senegalese Solicitor &amp; Financial Attorney/Consultant.I was the personal attorney to late Daniel Thorp who was an expatriate mining consultant/contractor with Teaser Petroleum Corporation in St Louis-Senegal.Mr. Daniel Thorp here-in-after referred as my client was also a Diamond/Gold Merchant.
 Mr.Daniel Thorp made a numbered time (Fixed) deposit for US$12
500
000.00 (Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars Only) in a bank in Dakar
 capital of Senegal with standing statement/agreement with the bank that all correspondences in respect to the fixed deposit contract must be sent to him through my humble chambers. Upon maturity
 the routine notification was sent to me whom I dispatched to his forwarding address as usual without no reply. After a month
 I sent areminder which I received from the bank without any reply again.
 Finally
 I discovered from my client’s contract employers- Teaser Petroleum Corporation that he died among many others in the Kenya Airways flight of 31st January
 2000 that crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in Abidjan
 Cote D’Ivoire. On further investigations
 I found out that he died without making any WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I also discovered that Mr. Daniel Thorp did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents
 including his fixed deposit contract with the bank in Dakar-Senegal.
 I am contacting you based on the official letter I just received from his bankers reminding me that Senegalese law states that at the expiration of 5 (five) years the money will revert to the ownership of the Senegalese Government if I do not confirm the next of kin to claim the fund.
 Consequently
 my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kinto Mr. Daniel Thorp so that the fruits of this old man’s labor will not go into the hands of some corrupt government officials. Note that this transaction is simple and risk free because I will provide expert legal services that will guarantee the successful execution of this deal.
 I wish to point out that after the claims
 I would want 20% of this money to be shared among charity organizations
 while the remaining 80% is shared equally between us. Most importantly
 I would also require your assistance towards investing my share in your country or anywhere as you may advice.
 If you are interested
 please contact me via my email address :davidchambers@katamail.com. Upon your response
 I shall provide you with more details and how we shall proceed with the claims. I expect you to observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be profitable for both of us.
 Awaiting your urgent reply via my email.

 Dearest Valued Friend

 It is with deep sense of honor and respect that I humbly make this appeal to you with the understanding that any fact/s or opinion/s expressed in this letter are given in confidence and solely for your personal information and use. If it does not interest you
 discard the mail but if it makes sense to you
 I open my arms wide to do business with you.
 I take liberty anchored on strong desire to solicit for your assistance on this mutual beneficiary and risk free transaction with you
 which I hope you give urgent attention. To be precise;
 Your information were given to me by a member of the South African Export Promotion Council (SAEPC) who was with the Black Economic Empowerment Commission (Government) delegation on a trip to the United States during abilateral conference talk to encourage foreign investors. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in execution of a deal hereunder for the benefit of all parties
 and hope you will keep it confidential because of the nature of this business. Within the Department of Mining Resources where I work as the Director of Project Implementation
 with co-operation of two other top officials
 we have in our possession
 an overdue payment in US funds. 
 The said funds represent certain percentage of the contract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by a foreign contracting firm
 which we the officials over-invoiced to the amount of US$41
500
000.00 (Forty One Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor
 leaving the excess balance unclaimed. The Government of the Republic of South Africa believe that private investment in general
 and foreign direct investment in particular
 are the real engines for sustainable economic development
 for which reason it has continued to encouraged investment in the key growth-oriented sector of Mining with sincere determination to pay foreign contractors all debts owed to them
 so as to continue to enjoy close relationship
 and mutually beneficial co-operation with foreign governments and non-governmental financial agencies. As a result we included our bills for approvals with the co-operation of some officials at the Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank of South Africa (RBSA). 
 "We are seeking your assistance to be the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds
 since we are not allowed to operate foreign account. The changing of beneficiarys information/ details and other forms of documentation upon application for claim to reflect the contract money and its approvals will be secured on behalf of your company or yourself.  "
 I have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that
 should you be willing to assist us in this transaction your share as compensation will be 20% while my colleagues and I shall receive 70%
 and the balance of 10% shall be used to reimburse all expenditures
 taxes and miscellaneous expenses so incurred.  It does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of the nature described here. 
 The assumption is that your company won the major contract and subcontracted it to other companies. More often than not
 big trading companies and firms of unrelated fields win major contracts
 and subcontract to more specialized firms for execution. 
 This business itself is 100% safe
 provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality. Also your specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this mutual beneficiary transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint us. Kindly notify me for further details
 upon your acceptance of this proposal. Please send all correspondence to and response to potobo1@netscape.net

 and all will be well at the end of the day.
 I decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction.
 To ease your apprehension

 I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased
 as all documentations will be carefully worked out by a lawyer for the funds Twenty- five million United States dollars (US$25
000
000.00) in a domiciliary account to be released in your favour as the beneficiarys next of kin."
 Because after six years the money will be called back to the bank treasury as unclaimed bills and the money shared amongst the directors of the bank. so it is on this note i decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the next of kin/beneficiary to this funds rather than allow the bank directors to share this money amongst themselves at the end of the year.
 It may interest you to know that we have secured from the probate an order of mandamus to locate any of the deceased beneficiaries.
 Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business endeavor by furnishing me with the following information if you are interested.

 and for us to see face to face.
 2. Details
 particulars of your contact address.
 3. Direct Telephone and fax numbers;. For our personal contact and for the confidentiality of this transactions.
 I shall be compensating you with 25% of the total sum on final
 conclusion of this project for your assistance
 as I have also thought of doling out 5% to charity organisation from your locality based on your recommendation another 5% for the services of the lawyer while the balance 65% shall be for me for investment purposes in your country as I cannot bring back this cash to my country.

 On the 21st of October 2000
 my client
 his wife Valerie and their two children (Larry and Daren) died in an auto crash on one of Nigerian roads. Since then I have made several enquiries to the Embassy to locate any of my clients extended relatives without success. After several unsuccessful attempts
 I decided to look for somebody abroad who is reliable and trustworthy I will forward as next of kin to receive his fund
 hence I contacted you. I am contacting you to assist in claiming the money left behind by my client before the bank confiscates or declare the fund unserviceable. 
 "Until his death
 my client had
 and maintained a US Dollar currency deposit account with a closing balance of US$19.5M (Nineteen Million
 Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) with a Trust Bank in North America
 and have written us to recover all such dormant and unclaimed accounts to reinvest it with other funds through the capital market
 but we have cleverly written and asked them to release the fund based on the instruction of the next of kin. It is for the urgency of this claim that I write to you to stand and receive the money as Mr. Allens next of kin since I have failed in attempts in locating the relatives for over 2 years now. I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased since I have perfectly procure all the vital documents that would aid the release of the money and forward it either to Europe or America whereby you will receive the money. "
 I am prepared to disburse the money among ourselves in the following ratio: Beneficiary/next of kin 30%
 5% for Bank and legal expenses
 while my colleague and myself in the chambers shall have 65%. 
 If this proposal is acceptable to you and you do not intend to take undue advantage of the trust we shall bestow on you
 then kindly respond immediately
 furnishing me with your confidential telephone and fax numbers. I have all necessary legal documents for the release of the fund. On indicating your willingness
 I shall contact you for us to work out the modalities for you to receive the funds. All I require is your honesty and co-operation. I guarantee that this will be executed under legitimate arrangements that will protect you from any breach of the law.

 the manager credit and foreign bills of African Developement Bank Ltd Dakar Senegal Branch . I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank with account number 14-255-2004/adb/t
 Mr.Gerald Smith who died in a plane crash (EgyptAir Flight 990)which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean on October 31st
1999 with other passengers on board.You can view this web site for more story of the inccident http://www.cnn.com/US/9911/02/egyptair990.list/index.html
 Since the death of this customer
 I personally have watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds of US$13
000
000.00(Thirteen Million Dollars) which has been with my bank for a very long time. On this note I decided to seek for whose name shall be used as the next of kin as no one has come up to be the next of kin.
 In view of this I got your contact through my country?s foreign trade mission after I was convinced by providence that your name could be used as the next of kin.The request of the foreigner as a next of kin in this business is occasioned by thefact that the customer was a foreigner and a Senegalias cannot stand as the next of kin to a Foreign client
 I agreed that 30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner in respect of providing a new bank account or we can use your old accountinformation
while the rest will be for me
 thereafter
 I will visit your country for disbursement as I am almost due for retirement.Therefore
 to facilitate the immediate transfer of this fund to your account as
 arranged
 we must engage the services of a lawyer to apply on your behalf to the bank as a relation to the deceased.I need you to indicate in your response
 your private telephone and fax numbers for easy communication and your complete bank information where the money will be remitted into for our mutual benefit. Upon the receipt of your reply
 I will send you by fax or e-mail the next step to take. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any fear as every modality and machinery for the success of this transaction have been put in place.
 You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this

 In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of £12.5million British Pounds Sterling (Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand British Pounds Sterling) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers Late Mr. Morris Thompson an American who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines
 Flight 261
 which crashed on January 31 2000
 including his wife and only daughter. You shall read more about the crash on visiting this website.
 http://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.html
 Since we got information about his death
 we have been expecting his next of kin or relatives to come over and claim his money because the Bank cannot release the funds unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.
 "Unfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin being his only daughter died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the knowledge of this fund behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and two other officials in this department now decided to do business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin or beneficiary of the funds for safe keeping and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want this money to go back into Government treasury as unclaimed bill."
 We agreed that 20% of this money would be for you as foreign partner
 while the balance will be for my colleagues and I. We will visit your country for the disbursement according to the percentages indicated above once this money gets into your account.  Please be honest to me as trust is our watchword in this transaction.
 Please note that all necessary arrangement for the smooth release of these funds to you has been finalized. We will discuss much in details when I do receive your response.
 Please in your response include your telephone and fax numbers for a better communication between us.

DEAR SIR/MADAM
 
 I am Mr. GABRIEL MEDEI
 Bank Manager {Hillbrow Branch} of Amalgamated Bank Of South Africa {ABSA}. I got your email contact
 in my search for a trusted partner
 who will assist me with this confidential business proposal. 
 Mr. Stev  Jam made a numbered times (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months
 valued at US$25
000.00 (twethy- five Million US Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity
 I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month
 we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers
 National Mining Corporation that Mr. Stev Jam died from an auto accident. 
 On further investigation
 I found out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Stev Jam did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents
 including his Bank Deposit paperwork. This sum of US$25 M  is still sitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at every end of   each year. No one has come forward to claim it. According to the South African Law
 at the expiration of 6{Six} years

 MR Anijah Akpundu.

This letter must come to you as a big surprise
 but I believe it is only a day that people meet and become great friends and business partners.
 good faith
 believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you.
 I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On November 6
 2000
 an Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the
 CHEVRON PETROLEUM CORPORATION
 MR. KHALIL AL NASSER made a (Fixed deposit) for 36 calendar months
 valued at
 US$17
500
000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my bank and I happen to be his account officer before I was
 moved to my present position recently. Upon maturity in 2003
 as his account officer and as well the bank manger
 it is my duty to notify him on
 the maturity date so I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but the letter was returned undelivered.
 After sometime
 I tried sending back the letter
 but it was again returned and finally I discovered from his contract employers
 Chevron Petroleum
 Corporation that Mr. Khalil Al Nasser died as a result of torture in the hand of Saddam Hussein (former Iraqi President) during one of his trips to
 his country Iraq
 as he was accused of leaking information to the Americans.
 On further investigation
 I discovered that Mr. Al Nasser’s family wife and two sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he
 did not declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents
 including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did not leave any
 WILL. This sum of US$17
500
000.00 have been floating and placed under dormant/unserviceable account by my bank management since no
 one have heard from the owner since 2003. I wish to let you know that all the investigation I have made so far
 my bank management is not
 With the recent change of government in my country and with their efforts to support the United Nations in checkmating terrorism aid in the U. A. E.
 By end of this year
 the government will pass a new financial control law which will give the government authority to interrogate account owners of
 immediately
 by end of the year the government will definitely confiscate the money
 because my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain
 the source of the money.
 I cannot directly transfer out this money without the help of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance. As the Account Officer to
 late Al Nasser
 coupled with my present position and status in the bank as Head of Retail Banking Group
 I have the power to influence the release of
 the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account
 with the correct information concerning the account
 which I shall give you.
 All documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully worked out and there is practically no risk involved
 the transaction will be executed under 
 a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law
 beside U. A. E is porous and anything goes.
 interested
 contact me as soon as you receive this message so we can go over the details. Thanking you in advance and may God bless you.
 Please
 treat with utmost confidentiality. I shall send you copy of the deposit certificate issued to Al Nasser when the deposit was made for your perusal.
 I wait your urgent reply through my private email address: drateeq299@yahoo.com.au

 Dearest one

 Permit me to inform you of my desire to go into business relationship with you

 the economic capital of Ivory Coast
 he was poisoned to death by his business associates on one of their business meeting. My mother died on the 20th october 1988 and my father took me so special because l am motherless. 
 He also explained to me that it was because of this wealth that he was poisioned by his business associates 
 that l should seek for a GOD fearing foreign partner in a country of my choice where l will transfer this money and use it for proper investment purpose 
that I must finish my university education by the help of a business partner abroad
that he or she should help me obtain a resident permit in his or her country.He also gave a standing instrution to the company that the
 deposit must be transferred outside this country. According to my father
the money was deposited as art works to avoid attracting attention to the deposit. 
 (2) To make arrangement for me to come over to your country in order to further my university education and to secure a residential permit for me in your country.
 Moreover sir
 l am willing to offer you 15% of the total sum as compensation for your assistance in the transfer of this deposit to your country. Furthermore

I want to solicit with you for assistance in regards to a financial
 Zimbabwe that was murdered for land dispute in my country. Before the death
 family valuables
 when he realized the looming dangers in Zimbabwe.
 This amountwas meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals for
 the farms and also for the establishment of new farms in Swaziland.This land
 dispute started when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land
 reform
which was particularly targeted at the rich white farmers and a few
 black farmers (my father included).This resulted in the gruesome killing of
 rich farmers (mainly whites) and the unlawful possession of their properties
 "by Mugabes war veterans
 under the  disguise of fighting for the interest"
 of the country. It is against this background that I fled the country with
 my family
to the United Kingdom where we are currently seeking asylum.I have
 been adviced to seek foreign assistance
 as the United Kingdom law prohibits
 asylum seekers from operating bank accounts or involve in financial
 trustworthiness to be able to entrust the above said amount and help me
 "with investment opportunities. My familys survival depends on this money"
 There are two options
 firstly
 you can choose to accept a negotiable
 percentage of the total amount for your assistance or go into partnership
 for the proper investment of the money in your country.
 We shall discuss in detail the modalities involved when I hear from you.
 I await your reply through my confidential email media
 while I implore you
 to maintain the absolute secrecy required to ensure a safe and hitch free
 transaction.
 I shall furnish you with more details on request.

Sir

 I personally decided to put in writing as below
 the full details of this business proposal that I have been trying to explain to you. I have a re-profiling amount in an excess of US$78M
 which I seek your partnership in accommodating for me. I am willing to give out 25% of this total sum to you for your quick assistance and partnership
 70% for me and while 5% should be set side for reimbursement of any unforeseen expenses we both might incure in the cause of this transaction. However
 I sincerely seek your confidence in this transaction
 which I am proposing to you.
 My name is Bartholomew mutie
 I am the personal assistance to the former President of Republic of Liberia (President Charles Taylor). President Charles Taylor decided on the 11th of August 2003 to go into exile in a neighboring country Nigeria to seek asylum.  Based on these developments
 his various foreign bank accounts have been frozen and some are still under serious investigation. But in the light of all these happenings
 President Charles Taylor was able
 through the help of some loyalist succeeded to secretly move the sum of US$78M
 on my name as the owner to a private security company vault in
 Nigeria where the final crediting is expected to be carried out later
 but resently he has just been arrested and taken away. you can read more on CNN news of March 30
 2006. http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/africa/03/29/taylor.nigeria/index.html
 "All the depositing documents of the above fund were on my name and they are still in my possession
 What I need from you is to stand as the beneficiary of the above quoted sum and I will arrange for the documentation which will enable the Security Company transfer / wire the fund to your bank account. I have decided to do this only with you and use this sum to relocate to European or American continent and never to be connected to any of President Charles Taylors conglomerates. This transaction can be concluded within 2 weeks."
 My questions are:-
  1. Can you handle this project?
  3. can you keep this business as very confidential?
  4. If you can sponsor this transfer
 Is 25% acceptable to you
 as your commission?
 REPLY TO MY PRIVATE EMAIL ADDRESS:
 Consider this and reply as soon as possible to (my private email address) mutiebath@infinito.it
 so i can give you more clear explanations details and information about this transaction. I will also need your direct telephone and fax number for easy reach. Finally
 it is my humble prayer that the information as contained herein be accorded the necessary attention
 urgency as well as the secrecy it deserves. Please i need you to send me your telephone number so i can give you a call immediately for more discusion. As soon as I get your positive response
 I will send you more information to you.

  Compliments of the season. I am Mrs.\xa0Rose Bangra\xa0Hamenya
 a civil servant from Zimbabwe.\xa0I got your contact from\xa0Chamber and Commerce office as\xa0I was searching for someone who will help me\xa0 out of\xa0my present\xa0predicament
 
 "  My late husband
 Mr. Ransome Gatorgay Hamenya was the co-owner of an Agricultural firm and his partner happens to be among the white farmers that the dictator President of Zimbabwe
 Robert Mugabe took over their farmlands and handed over to the blacks
 despite all the pleas from the International Community
and members of the\xa0commonwealth countrys Most of the"
 " companys assets
animal farms and milk industry were seized and confiscated by the tyrant President. "
 "  My late husband was a British citizen of African descent and we both lived in the companys staff quarters but our lives were threatened by agents of President Mugabe. Since then
 my husband and I have been living in exile in Dakar - Senegal. My husband died last August as a result of cardiac arrest. "
   A\xa0substential\xa0amount of money was deposited in the\xa0finance house by\xa0my husband before his death through the help of the International Red Cross staff
 because President Mugabe
 placed order for the closure of the accounts of all the white farmers and no one is allowed to transfer more than ten thousand dollars abroad but luckily enough
 I and my late husband along with some other farmers were
  assisted through diplomatic means with the help of the International Red Cross to send our money abroad.
 The total Sum is\xa0FIFTEEN million US dollars (US$15.000.000.)
 
 the money is part of our savings and what my husband inherited from his late father
 from whom we took over the family business.\xa0 All the documents to the deposition of the money are with me\xa0and with the finance firm also for Security reasons. 
 I would like you to assist me to relocate the money to your country into any account of your choice or keep it for me in your safe custody until I am able to come to your country after my operation soon. I would like to invest the money into any lucrative business
 you deem profitable and your assistance is highly needed in the areas of investment feasibility studies. 
   Hence I need your cooperation to secure this deposit which is as it stands now
 the only hope of\xa0my
 " survival as I have already lost my husband
 coupled with my sickness and the situation of insecurity. Life is no more the same with me after all the lot I have gone through.Moreover
 I wouldnt mind paying you any amount you will charge me up\xa0to 20% of the total money for your assistance in relocating and keeping the money for me as well as helping me to carry out proper investment. You keep 80% for me pending execution of the investment. "
   As a sick person
 it will be difficult to handle this alone
 hence I need your immense help
 coupled with your distinguished business acumen and track record. Please
 I would like you to come to my assistance
 I am a lonely widow and in utter confusion and distress.
   \xa0This business is solely between two of us and should there be any need for a third party
 I will contact one of the Red Cross staff with whom I have
  established some trust. I am scared that if any one gets to know about this
 he might take advantage of my helpless situation. to diverte this fund or seat on the money without helping me to manageit as planed
so please if your willing to help kindly contact me through my email above. or my son\s email id (<a shape="rect" href="mailto:papis_prince@hotmail.com">papis_prince@hotmail.com</a>)

 Compliment Of The Season
 
 When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your capability and reliability to champion this businees opportunity when i 
 prayed to God or Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death
 we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relati on to the deceased as indica ted in our banking guidelines
 but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the 
 next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don’t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.
 The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years
 the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner
 and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner
 in respect to the provision of a foreign account
 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague. There after i will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. 
 Therefore to enable 
 the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged
 you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name
 your bank account number
 your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply
 I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for thetransfer. 
 You should contact me on my number 00226-7885 75 97\xa0immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately. 
 Your’s faithfully
\xa0

 he was a cocoa merchant and he was also in the government of my country. He was assasinated with the my mother and my two elder brothers by the rebels during the heat of the war in my country. The rebels claim that my father was in surport of the government during the war that devided my country into two part.
 Luckily for me
 I was away in the burden school in Ghana a neighbouring country. It was on the BBC Africa that I heard about the tragic death of my parents and brothers but my father was still alive at the time of gun shot and was ruched to the hospital. I was taken to the hospital where he was recieving treatment for gun wounds. One week before his death
 he called me to his bed side at the hospital and handed a document to me. The document is covering a deposit of\xa0nine\xa0 million five hundred thausand U.S dollars (U.S$9.5 000.000.00) which he deposited in a security company vault here in my home country. According to him he said this money is meant to establish his business in europe after his retirement. He instructed me to look for a trust worthy partner in over sea to confide the release of the fund into his account and relocate to his country to establish the money on a lucrative business and live my life quietly. He also said that the security company does not know the
  content of the safe Box
 that he\xa0deposited the contents as family valuable.
 Why am contacting you

Dear Friend.
 May almighty God bless you. I am Rev. Fr. Peter Clark
 a senior staff with the UN special duties office ;my office monitors and controls the affairs of all banks and financial institutions. I have before me list of funds
 which could not be transferred to some nominated accounts as these accounts have been identified either as ghost accounts
 unclaimed deposits or over-invoiced sum etc. I have the opportunity to write you based on the instructions among others i received days ago from the officer in the computer section in person of Engineer Peter Cliff
to bring out part of your total pending payment with reference number (LM-05-371) amounting US$10 million.The (Ten Million Dollars) is arranged in a security-proof box weighing 75kg. In order to get the box shipped to you.
 A lot of people are interested in your payment and those people are merely doing paper works with you and that explains why you receive different kinds of untrue fax and phone messages from different people everyday. As I found out that you have almost met all the statutory requirements in respect of your pending payment. Also we found out that some of the officials of the parastatals have been extorting money from you with the pretext of helping you receive your money. I can assure you this will keep happening if you do not do away with those officers.I am the final signatory to any transfer or remittance of huge funds moving within banks both on the local and international levels.
 A friend of mine who is a diplomat disclosed to me that there is a security courier service company that is specialised in sending diplomatic materials and information from one country to another
 with diplomatic immunity and consignment such as this cannot be checked by any customs anywhere in the world unlike Dhl
 Ems
 FedEx and Ups because
 they will have to open the box for inspection by the customs before shipment. I have therefore met the official of the security courier service and concluded shipping arrangement with them
 which they will commence as soon as I have your go ahead order. The diplomat will bring the consignment to you
 he has been in this line of work for many years now ;so you have notting to worry about.
 I am conditionally prepared to assist you get the money
 practically after studying the part leading to this particular stage in the payment process in connivance with your local collaborators to conceal the authentic source of the funds.And my only condition for this unusual assistance is after all arrangements we have concluded that you must donate Five Hundred Thousand United States dollars (US$500
000.00) to any charity organisation I designate as soon as you receive your money. To this effect
 you will send to us a promissory note for the donation along with your address where you will like the box to be delivered to by courier. 
 Please maintain topmost secrecy as it may cause a lot of problems if found out that we are using this way to help you. You are advised not inform anyone about this until you received your money. When you conclude this we will help to ship the final part of your money to you.
 Yours Faithfully

 by the Abu sayyaf movement in the southern luxury beach region on the 
 11th April 2002 that rendered many people of different nationals dead. 
 I inherited a total sum of 8.2 million dollars from my late 
 husband
This money which is concealed in a metallic trunk box is 
 deposited with a security and finance company AFRICA under a secret 
 arrangement as a family treasure. This means that the security company 
 does not know the content of this box that was shipped from the 
 Philippine to AFRICA  under a diplomatic coverage.
 My main purpose of sending you this mail is because of the way I found 
 you and perhaps trustworthy to give this priority of shipping this box 
 of money to any address that you think is very secure and safe in your 
 country with your percentage of which we shall discuss on soon. There 
 is need for urgent action because the consignment is accruing charges 
 per day as demurrage to the security company for safekeeping couple

     MY NAME IS MR MR Ken Edward
A former government official of Liberia. Following the exit of president CharlesTaylor of Liberia from power under a West African brokered peace agreement
 led by Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo he was granted asylum by the Nigerian Government. In my position as the Financial Secretary to the President and close confidant
 I left for Nigeria in his Entourage. My country has been engulfed in Protracted Civil war with rebels controlling some parts of the country. During the war
 President Taylor disbursed large sums of Monies to buy the loyalty of the entire cabinet
 and I can say with all modesty that I was one of the Chief Beneficiaries of this disbursement.
 This is aside from monies I used my official position to acquire while in office. Since we relocated to Calabar
 Southern Nigeria all has been well
 but with the recent indictment of former President Taylor by the war crime tribunal sitting in Sierra Leone and confirmed re ports of a dedicated fund by the American Government to capture him in order to face war crime charges have now decided to leave the country. Presently I have funds totaling United State $15
000
000.(Fifteen Million US Dollars) Which I intend to move oversea for investment and spend the rest of my life there with my family.
 This transaction is risk-free as all local arrangement has been made. If you are prepared to assist to work with me I require the following: Your Full Name and Office or House Address
Your Occupation
 Your Private Telephone
 Fax Num
 ber and private Email Address. As Compensation for your assistance you will retain 15% of the Total sum
 While 5% will be mapped out for local and International expenses.
 Though we are not known to each other
 I strongly believe that through this transaction we would be able to forge a mutually beneficial relationship between us
 now and in the future. Finally
 the success of this transaction will depend to a great extent on mutual trust
 secrecy and Confidentiality from you. I await your response by private E-mail ;(edward22ken@yahoo.it)

 ATTENTION: The President / Director

 I know that this message may come to you as a surprise since we do not know each other before
 but for purpose of introduction
 I am Dr I.B Skosana
 the chief Auditor in ABSA BANK of South Africa. 
 During my auditing work in the bank
 I found an account opened in this bank in 1992 and since 2000 nobody has operated on this account. After going through some old files in the record
 I discovered that the owner of this account is Mr. Smith.B. Andreas
 from MUNICH GERMANY and a miner at Kruger Gold Company who died along with his entire family in a plane crash. Since 2000
 No other person(s) knows about this account or any thing concerning it
 the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that his company does not know anything about this account and the amount involved is Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (US$12.5M).
 FOR MORE INFORMATION VISIT THIS SITE BELOW:
 http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm
 I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money cannot be approved to a local bank here
 but can only be approved to any foreign account because the money is in US Dollars and the former owner of the account Mr. Smith B. Andreas is a foreigner too. I need your full co-operation to make this transaction work
 because the management is ready to approve the transfer of this money to any foreigner who has correct information of this account
 which I will provide to you later. If you are able and willing to handle such amount in strict confidence and according to my instructions and advice for our mutual benefit because this is a lifetime opportunity. 
 With my position in the office I can lobby to transfer this money into your account
 with the assurance that the money will be intact pending my physical arrival in your country.
 I will destroy all documents of transaction immediately this money is transferred
 leaving no trace to any place. I will apply for my annual leave to get visa immediately I hear from you that you are ready to act and receive this fund in your account. I will use my position and influence to effect legal approvals and onward transfer of this money to your bank account with appropriate clearance forms from the appropriate ministries and foreign exchange departments. 
 Please reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step to take immediately. Send also your private telephone and fax numbers for easy communications. 
 At the conclusion of this business
 you will get 30% of the total amount
 65% will be for me
 while 5% will be for expenses both parties might incur during the transfer process. 
 I look forward to your earliest reply
 God Bless. 
 Sincerely Yours
 
 Dr.I.B Skosana (ABSA
Chief Auditor)

 My name is Miss Angela Kote. an orphan to the late former minister of finance in Sierra Leone Dr. Thomas kote who died as a result of rebel attack during one of their peace keeping forum in the year 2003. I inherited a total sum of $8.5 million US dollars from my late parents. 
 This money which is concealed in a metallic trunk box is deposited with a security and finance company in Ivory Coast under a secret arrangement as a family treasure. This means that the security company does not know the real 
 content of this box that was deposited in their security costody.
 My main purpose of sending you this mail is because of the way I found you and perhaps trustworthy to give this priority of shipping this box of money to any address that you think is very secured and safe in place with your percentage of which we shall chat on soon. I will come over to your country to continue my education as soon as the funds is claimed by you. 
 There is need for urgent action because I am paying US $45 dollars per day as a demurrage charges to the security company for keeping this consignment. I give thanks immensely for the co-operation as I look forward to hear from you soonest.
 You can still mail me on this address angkote@yahoo.com

My name is Mrs. Catherine O‘Connor. I trained and work as an external auditor for the International Financial Services Ltd for Anglo Irish Bank. Working as part of a bigger team that covers the entire Republic of Ireland region. I have taken pains to find your contact through personal endeavours.
 On routine audit check last month
 I discovered some investment accounts that has been dormant for the last twelve(12) years. All the accounts belonging to a single holder with monies totalling a little above ($17.1 Million United States Dollars) plus interest. Banking regulation/legislation in Ireland demand that I notify the fiscal authorities after a statutory time period of twelve years when dormant accounts of this type are called in by the monetary regulatory bodies. The above set of facts underscores my reason of writing and making the following proposal.
 My investigations of the said account reveals that the investor died in 1993—the exact time the account was last operated
 I can confirm with certainty that the said investor died interstate and no next–of–kin to his estate has been found or has come forward all these years.
 I am of the settled conviction that using my insider leverage
 I
 working with you can secure the funds in the account for us instead of allowing it pass as an unclaimed funds into the coffers of the Irish Government. This is especially possible as you bear the same LAST NAME to the said investor
 and can stand as his extended relative. This exactly is why I crave your participation and co-operation.
 I have seized all relevant documents (Legal and Banking) that will facilitate our putting you forward as the claimant/beneficiary of the funds and ultimately transfer the money to any account nominated by you. Of course you shall be handsomely rewarded for your part in this transaction as the people I am working with have agreed to allocate a 30% of the total funds for your efforts
 less any expenses.
 I shall however leave out the finer details of this transaction till I receive an affirmation of your desire to participate.
 Be assured that me and my colleagues are on top of the situation. There will be no risk involved whatsoever if you agree to come on board. Needless to say
 UTMOST CONFIDENTIALITY is of vital importance if we are to successfully reap the immense benefits of this transaction.
 To maintain the level of security required to see this transaction come to a successful conclusion
 I have intentionally left out the finer details.
 To affirm your willingness and cooperation to my proposal please contact me through email
 telephone/fax stating the followings for my confirmation:
 Your prompt response will be highly appreciated.
 Thank you

This letter must come to you as a big surprise
 but I believe it is only a day that people meet and become great friends and business partners. I am Mr. Majid Al-Hussein
 currently Chief Security Officer with a reputable security and finance company here in U. A. E. I write you this proposal in good faith
 believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.
 On November 10
 1999
 an Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the CHEVRON PETROLEUM CORPORATION
 Mr. Ahmed Haruna made a deposit of a trunk box in my company depository vault as family valuables
 unknowingly that the content of the trunk box were funds valued at US$17
500
000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only) in our company. This was my recent discovery that prompted me to take this very step of looking for someone to claim the funds with before it will get confiscated.
 Upon maturity in 2003
as the Chief security officer
 it is my duty to notify him on the maturity date so I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but the letter was returned undelivered. After sometime
 I tried sending back the letter
 but it was again returned and finally I discovered from his contract employers
 Chevron Petroleum Corporation that Mr.Ahmed Haruna died as a result of torture in the hand of Saddam Hussein (former Iraqi President) during one of his trips to his country Iraq
 as he was accused of leaking information to the Americans. On further investigation
 I discovered that Mr. Ahmed Haruna’s family wife and two sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he did not declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents
 including his Deposit paperwork in my Company and did not leave any WILL. This deposited trunk have been lying in our vault since the date of deposit
 and the management have decided to term it abandoned deposit and this will result confiscating it by our government since no one have heard from the owner since 2003.
 I wish to let you know that all the investigation I have made so far
 my company management is not aware of it
 I am the only one that have the information.
 As the Chief security Officer in my Company
 I have the power to influence the release of the deposit to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account
 with the correct information concerning the account
 which I shall give you. All documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully worked out and there is practically no risk involved
 the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law
 If you accept to work with me
 I want you to state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage
 so that both parties will be satisfied. If you are interested
 contact me as soon as you receive this message so we can go over the details.
 Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. Please
 treat with utmost confidentiality. I shall send you copy of the deposit certificate issued to Mr. Ahmed Haruna when the deposit was made for your perusal. I wait your urgent response.

Shenzhen
 China.
 Dear Kathleen Crain
 
 I am Zhang He
 Bank Manager of the Bank of China
 Shenzhen branch
 China. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. 
 On June 7
 2000
 a consultant/ contractor with the Chinese Solid Minerals Corporation
 made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months
 valued at Twenty One Million Dollars (US$21
000
000.00) only in my branch. Upon maturity
 I sent a routine notification to the forwarding address but got no reply. After a month
 we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers
 the South Korea Solid Minerals Corporation that he died along with his wife from a plane crash. On further investigation
 I found out that he died Without making a WILL
 and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. 
 I therefore made further investigation and discovered that he did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents
 including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. 
 This sum of US$21
000
000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. 
 According to Laws of China
 at the expiration of eight (8) years
 the money will revert to the ownership of the South Korea Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.

I am Mr MAXWELL TAMBO
 Bank Manager of a Reputable bank in Johannesburg
 Gauteng Province
 and Republic of South Africa. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.On feb 27
 2001
 a British Oil Consultant/contractor with the South African Mining Corporation
 (Name deliberately with held) made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months
 valued at US$50
000
000.00 (Ffity Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity
 I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.
 "After a month
 we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers
 the South African Mining Corporation
 that the depositor died from an automobile accident. On further investigation
 I found out that he died without making a WILL
 and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that  the depositor did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents
US$50
00
000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of Republic of South Africa
at the expiration of 5(five) years
 the money will revert to the ownership of the South African Government if nobody applies to claim the  fund.Consequently
 my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as THE NEXT OF KIN to the depositor so that the fruits of this old mans labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials."
 This is simple
 I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the Necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarisation of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favour for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60%for me and 35% for you and 5% for any expenses that we are going to incue.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested
 please reply immediately via the private email address.Upon your response
 I shall then  provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.
 Please send me your full name
address
 confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication.Also
Please observe utmost confidentiality
 and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.
 Thanks and Regards.

 Await your urgent response.
 Yours Sincerely

My name is Mr Gobind Singh Deo . I am a legal practitioner Gobind Singh Deo Chember in Johor Bahru
 Malaysia.
 I saw your contact and profile i decided that you could cooperate with me in this proposition.
 "I have a client who was deceased in November
 2001
  in Kuala Lumpur
 Malaysia.I am contacting you because you have the same surname as my deceased client and i felt that you could help me in the distribution of funding that were left in my deceased clients bank account. This funding is closed to be declared UN-serviceable by the bank as there were no indicated next of kin or next of beneficiary of the funding in the bank account."
 The total amount of cash in the bank account of my deceased client  is US$4.7 Million (  Say
 Four Million
 Seven Hundred Thousand US$ )
 only.
 The bank had  issued to me a notification to contact the next of kin of my deceased client for either to re-activate  the bank account  or to make claim of  beneficiary
  of the funding in the bank account
 with a month surcharge of 6% to be deducted as an Escrow safe keeping fee of the bank account
so as to avoid the indefinite closure of the bank account.
 My proposition to you is to seek your consent
 and  to present your kind self  as the next-of-kin and beneficiary of my deceased  client
 since you have the same last name with him.
  This means that the proceeds of his bank account  would be paid to you as his  next of kin or the legitimate beneficiary.  When  the proceeds in his bank account are  paid to you
  we would  share the proceeds on a mutually agreed-upon  percentage of 60% to me and 40% to your kind self.
 "All the legal documents to back up your claim as my clients next-of-kin would  be provided by me. The most important thing I would need is your honest cooperation to in this proposition.This would be done  under a legitimate arrangement that would protect you from any breach of the law."
 If this business proposition offends your moral and ethic values
 do accept my sincere apology. Please contact me at once if youe interested by replying the mail and ignore it if you are not.
 Best regards

 Mr Gobind Singh Deo Esq.

Greetings:
 I am sorry for sending you this message for the second time
 please bear 
 with me and respond.
 My name is Mr. Melvin Samson I work as an accountant in a bank; I contacted 
 "you to work together with me in claiming my late clients estate. "
 Unfortunately he died without a registered next of kin and as such the funds 
 now have an open beneficiary status. You could be made the beneficiary since 
 you share the same last name with him.
 This has officially transferred the right to you
 as no other person from 
 his family knows anything about this fund with our bank.If you are 
 interested in working with me

 please get back to me as quickly as possible so that I give you the details 
 you more briefing of what you need to and how to do it.
 Thanks for your co-operation.

 right now I have only about a few months to live
 according to medical
 experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well
 as I never really
 cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very
 rich
I was never generous
 I was always hostile to people and only focused
 onmy business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all
 this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or
 make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second
 chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how
 Now that God has called me
 I have willed and given most of my property
 and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as few
 have decided to give alms to charity organizations and those in Need
 as I
 distributed money to some charity organizations when I was well. Now that
 my health has deteriorated so badly
 I cannot do this myself anymore. I
 once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute
 the money which I have there to charity organization in United States

 Asia
 Middle East &amp; Europe
 they refused and kept the money to themselves.

 I do not trust them anymore

 To whom it may concern
 It is my pleasure to write this mail to you and to say thank you for your effort in providing an opportunity to read my mail. I got your contact when I was making some searches on the internet. My name is Ahmed Abdul Kadir
 a sudanese refugee; my Father was until recently
 one of the personal aid to the former President of Iraq who was overthrown out of power during the War in Iraq which took many lives.
 I am contacting you to seek your co-operation in investing US$10.5 Million in your country or any other with good economic prospect. My late father was able to safe guard the fund with the contacts he had in the Diplomatic Corps and the funds are being held under the protection and custody of a Diplomat friend of his. I have decided to contact you because I am interested in investing these funds. Please kindly guide and assist me in making the right investment as I am really a novice when considering the technicalities and logistics involved in running a business.
 The details of the investment will be worked out to our respective satisfaction. In view of your participation
 I am ready to give you a good negotiable percentage for your assistance
 or better still commit it into a viable joint venture. Be assured that you stand no risk of any kind as the funds belong to me as the only surviving son and as soon as I get your consent
 the necessary papers will be drawn up to facilitate the movement to the funds to your country for the investment.
 However
 upon your acceptance to work as my partner

I am Mr MAXWELL TAMBO
 Bank Manager of a Reputable bank in Johannesburg
 Gauteng Province
 and Republic of South Africa. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.On feb 27
 2001
 a British Oil Consultant/contractor with the South African Mining Corporation
 (Name deliberately with held) made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months
 valued at US$50
000
000.00 (Ffity Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity
 I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.
 "After a month
 we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers
 the South African Mining Corporation
 that the depositor died from an automobile accident. On further investigation
 I found out that he died without making a WILL
 and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that  the depositor did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents
US$50
00
000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of Republic of South Africa
at the expiration of 5(five) years
 the money will revert to the ownership of the South African Government if nobody applies to claim the  fund.Consequently
 my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as THE NEXT OF KIN to the depositor so that the fruits of this old mans labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials."
 This is simple
 I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the Necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarisation of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favour for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60%for me and 35% for you and 5% for any expenses that we are going to incue.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested
 please reply immediately via the private email address.Upon your response
 I shall then  provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.
 Please send me your full name
address
 confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication.Also
Please observe utmost confidentiality
 and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.
 Thanks and Regards.

My name is Mr. Femi Gidado
 manager
 credit and oreign bills of CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA (C.B.N). I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank with account mber14-255-2004/utb/t who perished in a plane 
 crash [Korean Air Flight 801] with the whole assengers aboard on August 6
 1997.Since the demise of this our customer
 I personally has watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive 
 as no one has come to claim his funds of $20 m
 [twenty million united states dollars]which has been with my branch for a very long time.
 On this note
 I decided to seek for whom his name hall be used as the next of kin as no one has come up to be the next of kin. And the banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay In view of this I got 
 your contact while searching through the internet after realizing that your name and country is similar to the deceased.
 I will give you 40% of the total sum. Upon the receipt of your sponse
 I will send you by e-mail the application and the next step to take. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized with in five banking days
 after you apply to the bank as a 
 elation to the deceased.
 When you receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail signifying your decision including your private or mobile Telephone numbers for quick communication.
 Respectfully submitted

Dear Sir

        It is my pleasure to write this mail to you and to say thanks for your effort in providing an opportunity to read my mail. I got your contact when i was making some searches in the internet.
 My name is Mrs Atiya Mohameed
 a Liberian. I was until recently the wife of Mr. Ibrahim Mohameed  who was the chief army officer to my country Libera. I am contacting you  to seek your co-operation in investing $USD10.M in your company or your country
s economy.
 My  husband made this money when he was on sit as the commander and chief army officer while  Charles Taylor is the president  of Liberia.
 Due to some religious and political problems 
 my husband was  hijacked and brutally assasainated by the rebel leathers in Liberia.
 "It is worthy to note that during my husbands life time he used his position as a former chief aid to must have made this money in question."
 "This money was realised from  the sales of gold and diamond 
which are the countrys major resources and sources of income.And before his death 
my husband was able to send this money via a Ghanian diplomatic contact to the country 
where it is currently secured with a security company as a FAMILY  TREASURE"
  and  my name was used as the depositor in view of my husband
s position as an insider in the government.
 And it was my husband
s refusal to realise the money to former President Charles Taylor that resulted in the killing in February 2003.
 Now 
 that i have passed through the mourning ordeal for my husband  I am   thinking and planning the next step to take with respect to how  and where  to invest the money.
 "So my aim of sending this mail to you is to solicit your assistance in transfering this money to your country where it could be invested in a viable business for our mutual benefit. I am ready to enter into a joint venture with your company or we can open a new company with the money because im sure the money inside the box can establish a company of any type."
 I want to assure you that you will be highly rewarded for your assistance both in cash or in the joint venture.
 Please reply to this mail
 indicating your ability to handle this transaction so that i will give you details to enable us map out strategies for the implementation of this project.
 Best regards

 Mrs.Atiya Mohameed
