 YOUR SINCERELY


I am Mr. Ben Suleman a custom officer and work as Assistant controller of the Customs and Excise department Of the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs stationed at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport
 Ikeja
 Lagos-Nigeria.
 After the sudden death of the former Head of state of Nigeria General Sanni Abacha on June 8th 1998 his aides and immediate members of his family were arrested while trying to escape from Nigeria in a Chartered jet to Saudi Arabia with 6 trunk boxes Marked "Diplomatic Baggage". Acting on a tip-off as they attempted to board the Air Craft
my officials carried out a thorough search on the air craft and discovered that the 6 trunk boxes contained foreign currencies amounting to US$197
570
000.00(One Hundred and  Ninety-Seven Million Five Hundred Seventy Thousand United States Dollars).
 I declared only (5) five boxes to the government and withheld one (1) in my custody containing the sum of (US$30
000
000.00) Thirty Million United States Dollars Only
 which has been disguised to prevent their being discovered during transportation process.Due to several media reports on the late head of state about all the money him and his co-government officials stole from our government treasury amounting
 to US$55 Billion Dollars (ref:ngrguardiannews.com) of July 2nd 1999. Even the London times of July 1998 reported that General Abacha has over US$3.Billion dollars in one account overseas. We decided to conceal this one (1)box till the situation is calm and quite on the issue. The box was thus deposited with a security company here in Nigeria and tagged as "Precious Stones and Jewellry" in other that its
 content will not be discovered. Now that all is calm
 we (myself and two of my colleagues in the operations team) are now ready to move this box out of the country through a diplomatic arrangement which is the safest means. 
 However as government officials the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us by law to operate any foreign account or own foreign investment and the amount of money that can be found in our account
 cannot be more than our salary on the average
 thus our handicapp and our need for your assistance to help collect and keep safely in your account this money.
 Therefore we want you to assist us in moving this money out of Nigeria. We shall definitely compensate you handsomely for the assistance. We can do this by instructing the Security Company here in Nigeria to
 move the consignment to their affiliate branch office outside Nigeria through diplomatic means and the consignment will be termed as Precious Stones and Jewelleries" which you bought during your visit to Nigeria and is being transfered to your country from here for safe keeping. Then we can arrange to meet at the destination country to take the delivery of the consignment. You will thereafter open an account there and lodge the Money there and gradually instruct remittance to your Country. 
 This business is 100% risk free for you so please treat this matter with utmost confidentiality .If you indicate your interest to assist us please just e-mail me for more Explanation on how we plan to execute the transaction.
 Expecting your response urgently.
 Best regards

 Mr. Ben Suleman

It is with a heart full of hope that I write to seek your help in respect of the context below. I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha the former first lady of the former Military Head of State of Nigeria General Sani Abacha whose sudden death occurred on 8th of June 1998 as a result of cardiac arrest (heart attack) while on the seat of power. 
 I have no doubt about your capability and good-will to assist me in receiving into your custody (for safety) the sum of US$25 Million willed and deposited in my favour by my late husband in a security and deposit company. Though my contact to you for this assistance is not anchored on any personal ecommendation
 I pray your understanding
 good will and sincere assistance to respond to this message with honest intensions and concern. 
 "This money is currently deposited here with a security company as miscellaneous awaiting collection and according to the agreement entered into at the time of deposit between my late husband and the Security Company at the time of deposit; the collection centre is in Ghana. As it is legally required
 the administration of my late husbands properties is under the authority of the familys lawyer Tony Musa. "
 My Dear JK
 since the demise of my husband
 the present regime has been probing my late husband\s wealth and properties
 the London Newsweek of 13th march 2000 referred. The investigating team led by Enrico Monfrini
 the lawyer acting on behalf of the Nigerian government has so far submitted their report and presently
 some liquid cash and assets
 movable and immovable
 have been frozen and seized both locally here and internationally and my last hope is rested on the immediate security of this fund in your custody. Also
 Johnnie Cochran
 the lawyer who defended OJ Simpson
 has been brought in by the Abacha entourage to help them retain the disputed funds. Fortunately
 our family lawyer had secretly protected the "Personal will" of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the willed money be urgently moved into an overseas account of Trusted Foreign family friend without delay. For security reasons and f!
 urther advise
! no relations or fr! 
 iends of ours should be used; as this is a measure of security. The government had earlier placed foreign travel embargo on all our family members and seized all known local and International outfits of our business empire. 
 The situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the assistance of well-wishers. In view of this plight
 I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this "SOS" call to save my children and I from a hopeless future. 
 I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort
 immensely
 which will be discussed between you
 the Attorney and I. On your immediate response
 the Attorney will travel to Ghana where both of you will meet
 and thereafter proceed to the deposit company for the claims. 
 The documentations include
 most importantly
 Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit amongst few others. These documents will be sent to you by Fax
 as you would have to present them for proper claims. 
 Please
 be rest assured that this transaction is completely safe and legal but must be kept strictly to yourself even after the funds have been secured into our custody. This is so because any leakage of information could ruin the whole transaction. 
 Please all contacts must be made through my lawyer on his email: tony_m@lawyer.com This has to be so as he has been mandated to handle this matter and I have fully briefed him (my Attorney) on my contact to you. Due to my present circumstance
 I have handed everything over to him to co - ordinate and finalize with you and I will communicate you as at when necessary. Please for the safety of this transaction
 reply stating your phone and fax numbers to enable them contact you directly without running the risk of mail interception. 
 I look forward to your quick response. 
 Best Wishes

 My name is Mr.Michael Kamah
 the second son of Mr.Smith  Kamah
 of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country
in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president
Mr.Robert G.Mugabe
in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country
my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february
2002
 in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father
during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers
which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough
the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block an!
 d confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers
along with the assets of these white farmers themselves
that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa
where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.
 During my fathers life on earth
he had deposited the sum of Seven Million and Four Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$7.400.000.00]
in a trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers
 awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination
which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father
and with the present clamp down
killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country
I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally
to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present Mugab!
 "es regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit."
 Now this is what I actually want you to do for me;
 1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose
 with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.
 2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. 
 Please
I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now
and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request
I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.
 Best Regards

 Dear Sir/Madam
 SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE. 
 Please permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. This is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trust worthy foreign partner. This request may seem strange and unsolicited but I crave your indulgence and pray that you view it seriously. My name is COL. MICHAEL BUNDU of the Democratic Republic of Congo and one of the close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory
 may his soul rest in peace. 
 Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in my country
 I and some of my colleagues were instructed by Late President Kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of Twenty Million
 Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20
500
000.00) to fight the rebel group. We were then given this money privately by the then President
 LAURENT KABILA
 without the knowledge of other Cabinet Members. But when President Kabila was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his bodyguards a day before we were schedule to travel out of Congo
 We immediately decided to put the funds into a private security company here in Congo for safe keeping. 
 The security of the said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman
 and some other Military Personnel from our same tribe
 by the new President of the Democratic Republic of Congo
 the son of late President Laurent Kabila
 Joseph Kabila. 
 In view of this
 we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary. 
 "WE have sufficient CONTACTS here to move the fund under Diplomatic Cover to a security company in Europe in your name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked CONFIDENTIAL and it "
 will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance. 
 Our inability to move this money out of Congo all this while stems from our lack of trust of our supposed good friends (western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late President Kabila
 immediately after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other
 the information We gathered from an associate who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with your sincere assistance
 this transaction will be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two weeks. The said money is a state fund and therefore requires a total confidentiality. 
 We would please need you to stand on our behalf as the beneficiary of this fund in Europe. This is because we are under restricted movement and watch and hence we want to be very careful in order not to lose this fund which we have worked so hard for. Thus
 if you are willing to assist us to move this fund out of Congo
 you can contact me through my email addresses
 Tel/Fax nos. above with your telephone
 fax number and personal information to enable us discuss the modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us.
 "Please note that There are no RISKS involved in this Deal as everyones Security is Guaranteed if we follow the required guidelines. I will hence furnish you with further details of this Deal as soon as I am assured of your Sincere interest to assist us. "
 I must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential

 I am Mr George Mboro 
 a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources. First and foremost
 I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude
 but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me.
 I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction. Within the Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials
 we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Eighteen Million
 Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars (US$18
500
000.00) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so
 we are handicapped in the circumstances
 as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction.
 This amount (US$18.5m) represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm
 which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor
 leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you. I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction
 your share of the sum will be 30% of the US$18.5 million
 60% for us and 10% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe
 on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hind!
 rance to the successful execution of this transaction.
  I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my above tel/fax number 
or my email address:mboro@accountant.com whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not
 it will enable me contact other another Foreign partner with recommendation to carry out this deal. I want to assure you that myself and my partners are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and Please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matter; because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this business. 
 I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation. I am available to entertain any questions concerning the clarity of this transaction.
  Yours faithfully

Importance: HIGH
 Good day

  This might seem very deplorable for a person that you do not know. My name is Clement Apute
I am a lawyer and a very close confidant to my client who also happens to be my sister-in-law.
 "I am contacting you because of the my clients urgent need to go into partnership with someone
who is not from this country
 as a result of their familys present situation in the country
and specifically because you have a fixed address or let me say fixed responsibilities
 which can stands as a good reason to go into partnership with you. "
 The present situation right now
 requires good understanding and a good sense of judgment.
 "My sister-in-law and her entire family are really suffering from the hands of some wicked people who are drunk with power.This is just a personal vendetta by the head of states
 because he was jailed by my client husbands regime in 1997
 for actually plotting a coup d etat against their military administration then
 when they were in power. "
 "It is very clear that our present head of states wants to take advantage of his seat in power to settle his personal hatred for my clients family."
 "This man is bent on destroying my clients family. The family has virtually lost all their familys money and properties due to this vindictive administration in power now. who are bent on dealing with the family."
 All their bank accounts have been frozen
assets and their properties which I helped in managing have been confiscated and are still non functional till this present day.
  His administration has spread so much rumors against their family
 which is yet another smear campaign aimed mainly to frustrate
 humiliate
 dismember and widen the scope of
 Right now it is completely impossible for any member of the family to make any move because the entire family are being placed under traveling restrictions.About a few months ago we were squished out of another US$395 million dollars
 and these wicked people have completely dammed the fact that all this funds can be ascertained for independently.
 Presently
 the family is finding it very hard to manage as we have completely run out of resources
 because everything has been taken away from madam and her children. My client needs sombody that she can confide in
presently the family still has some amounts of money to the sum of 84 million US dollars and some fractions in cash
which the family has spread out and lodged in the vault of different Securities outfits in two countries there in Asia and also in Europe.
 "The existence of these monies is not in any way known to anybody else
not even all mamas children
 apart from her eldest son. The money was lodged in as jewelry. This is a precaution to maintain a very high level secrecy
 because this is all the family have left to fall back on. So we expect you to keep this matter in confidence."
 Madam wants a partner to proceed as soon as possible and retrieve some money lodged in any of this security outfits and handle it as duly instructed. The family needs somebody to help them withdraw there deposits because the family is financially down here in the country
 since everything they own here have been taken away from them. We are looking for an understanding partner that can work with us. 
 All we require from you is to help the family
 "to go and retrieve any one of the familys deposits that is lodged in one of these places and keep safely in your care
 since none of us is able to travel out of this country due to traveling restrictions."
 Secondly
so that you can always withdraw little part out of their money that will be in your possession and send it down here to us here
anytime the family is in great need. In this way they can continue to sustain the family until they are free from thier enemies.
  As their lawyer i will be instructing
 on how you will go about that. We will be providing you with
 all the legal documents to make claim on behalf of my client. 
 Please be rest assured that you will have no problems or difficulties in claiming any of these deposits because nobody is aware of the existence of this money. All the details will be given to you when we open up negotiations and arrive at a reasonable compromise and until I gain your trust to see that we can work together.
  We will negotiate on a certain percentage share of the money that the family will offer to you for your expected assistance and partnership. 
 Please do inform me on your decision immediately
 so as to stop further contacts. I await your response. NOTE - You can also get in contact with me via my secured
 email:clem-aputa@earthling.net
 I will like to have your private phone number so that we can discuss better.

 Late Monsieur. Ives Laurent (a French citizen and an Engineer executing major Federal contract with governments of West African sub region). He died with a fellow business associate in a ghastly auto crash last October and his remains have since been incarcerated. Since his death
 we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and put claims as the next of kin and beneficiary to the resources in Monsieur. Ives Laurent account
 for it is against the ethics and norms of the finance institution to claim such resources without a beneficiary unless proclaimed by the government.
 The federal government of Nigeria has given directives to finance institutions to declare adamant accounts that has stayed more than 8months in their custody as they intend to use it to pay off her military peace keeping force (ECOMOG) who fought in War ravaged African countries precisely and as the case may be
 Late Monsieur. Ives Laurent account fell into this category thus the necessity for contacting you for I am determined to move this fund out as the rigorous and rash economic decision and policies has really turned we government workers to mere civil laborers. I have worked for almost a decade and half and I have nothing to show as reaps and rewards of my hard earned labor.        
 As I need a next of kin/beneficiary and financial assistance to re-claim this resources for I cannot take on this project alone. My attorney and I have propose a commission of 25% out of the total resources for your kind assistance and five 5% has been mapped out to be reimbursed to both parties as sundry expenses incurred in the course of this business.
 To commence this transaction
 I require you to immediately indicate your interest by a return correspondence to this fax number 234-9-2726223 and enclose your private contact telephone number
 fax number
 full name &amp; address
 and your designated bank coordinates to enable us file a letter of claim to the appropriate departments for necessary approvals before the transfer could be made.  Note also that this business must be kept strictly confidential because of its nature and can be finalized within a short time depending on the level of your commitment/swiftness.
 I look forward to receiving your prompt response.

 all their foreign and local count was frozen and their assets confiscated. The wife
 who is now on her sick bed helplessly since her husbands death with her only son to look after
 wishes to move out of South-Africa the sum of USD$75 million . She wishes to invest the a for mentioned sum on real estate property/viable inves!
 tments overseas. For obvious reasons
 my client does not want to place this fund with established financial institution with the family name forsecurity reasons. It is her desire that the deal be handled as quietly as possible without possibility of any leakage to the public or Government. She has therefore empowered me to find and negotiate for a reliable and trustworthy foreigner who can assist us by using his/her name in moving the money to a foreign safe account and who can assist to invest the fund properly for the family. If you agree to act as a fund manager for my client and the family
 I shall release the sum of $75 USD[seventy five million united states dollars] to you if you meet my requirements.The money is available safe with a private security company coded and lodged in with a fictitious name. Upon a favorable response from you
 I shall let you know the steps involve. Your commission shall be down payment of 25% of the total sum

 YOURS FAITHFULLY

 MR PETER WILLIAMS

With warm heart I offer my friendship
 and send my best wishes in this special season.
 However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you
 as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past
 I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. I also sincerely seek your confidence
 as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity.
 First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi
 I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi
 leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct
 I selected your email address from an internet directory
 in my search for a partner
 hence this email. 
 "My Uncle(Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola
 led by President Dos Santos
 on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death
 Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command
 assumed office as leader of UNITA
 due to lack of the Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo
 there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions
 including Mr.Dembo
 planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncles death. As I lost my mentor in this struggle which has been on for three decades now
 not so much of this struggle interests me anymore
 as there is now no sense of direction. I now desire a peaceful life
 as I am no more interested in conflicts and wars. For this reason
 I secretly left Angola and came here (Holland) to seek!"
  political asylum.
 "I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your highly needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncles money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million)
 which was already on its way to my Uncles Swiss Bank account
 through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad
 and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam
 Holland in February when the tragic incident of my Uncles death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited for sometime now for security reasons
 and have now deicded to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact
 the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit. "
 "President Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncles assets and accounts abroad
 to ground UNITA
 and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds to the here."
 I plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to put in you is extraordinary
 and an act of desperation on my part
 in order not to lose this money. Also
 ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy.
 Your role in this project
 is clearing the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name
 from the Security company
 after which
 the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted
 and I have permission to do business and open an account here. 
 I have with me
 the Certificate of Deposit for the consignment containing the funds
 which will be used for claim from the security company
 and the release codes of the vaults. Also
 everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you
 and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response.
 I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal. 
 Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.

Dear Sir

 First I must solicit your confidence in this transaction
 this is by virtue of it�s nature as being very CONFIDENTIAL. 
 I am a Senior Manager with a commercial bank . I came to know of you in my private search for a reliable and reputable person to handle this confidential transaction
 which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign country.
 THE PREPOSITION
 The late  JERRY ADAMS a Foreigner and an oil merchant / contractor with the Federal Government of Nigeria until his death four years ago in a plane crash
 banked with us  and had a closing balance of USD10
000
000.00 (Ten Million United States Dollars).
 The bank now unquestionably expect it to be claimed by JERRY ADAMS� next of kin. Efforts have been made by my bank to get in touch with any of the ADAMS� Family but to no avail. It is because of the perceived possibility of not being able to locate JERRY ADAMS� next of kin (NOK) that the management under the influence of our Executive Director has agreed that since the incident occurred in 1997 and has left the fund dormant and devalued
 we should transfer the fund overseas and utilize it either on stock exchange market or personal business interest.
 Your role is very important as the fund when concluded on transfer would be justifiably presented as having been remitted to JERRY ADAMS� next of kin (NOK)  . Your interest will be protected as unnecessary documentation will be avoided. Note that all modalities necessary for execution of the business have been perfected. 
 Mr Temi Efosa
 The most personalized portal on the Web!

I am sending you this confidential email after searching through the Internet I passionate appeal to you for assistance. Many stories might be emanating from my country Nigeria that will cast some aspersions of doubt in your mind regarding this assistance I require from you.
 In the light of this
 I am Mr. Mohammed Abacha
 son of the late General Sanni Abacha the former military head of state of Nigeria. I have been in detention in the last four years following the death of my father for charges of State organized murder and corrupt practices. I have just been released by the Supreme Court a fourth night ago after the president brokered a deal with my family regarding my freedom. Having made my self-known
 I wish to emphasize that I need your assistance in the investment of some $35.5 Million USD of my family fund that have been held in a security company in Holland Amsterdam.
 Because of the tragic death of my father culminating to my prolonged detention
 my mother was too devastated to take charge of all the family estate. Now that I have regained my freedom
 I am soliciting for your assistance in the receipt of the fund from the security company in Holland for investment in viable areas of business interest under your prudent management.
 Conclusively
 I have decided to offer you 20%of the total sum for your assistance
 while 5% will be for whatever expenses that will be incurred while 75% is to be used in buying shares and franchise from companies in your country and maybe buy houses in your country subsequent to our free movement by the Nigerian Government.
 If this proposal appeals to your positive response
 please send to me immediately your contact address and telephone/fax numbers to enable me forward it to the security company in Holland.
 My contact person at the security company will direct and guide you accordingly. Please treat this with strict confidentiality.
 Yours faithfully

 Mohammed Abacha.

 Dear

 I am well confident of your capability to assist me in a transaction for mutual benefit of both parties
 ie(me and you) I am also believing that you will not expose or betray the trust and confidence I am about to establish with you. I have decided to contact you with greatest delight and personal respect.
 I am Mr Benard Gelicah Sankoh Son to FODAY SANKOH who was arrested by the ECOMAOG PEACE KEEPING FORCE months ago in my country Sierra Leone. Few days before the arrest of my father
 he confided in me and ordered me to go to his underground safe and move out immediately
 with a Deposit Agreement and Cash Receipt he made with a security Company where he deposited One Iron Box containing USD$22 million dollars cash (TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS).
 This money was made from the sell of Gold and Diamond by my father and he have already decided to use this money for future investment of the family.
 Thereafter
 I contacted the security company and notify them with the two documents and confirmed the deposit of the box by my father.
 Meanwhile
 my father have instructed me to look for a trusted foreigner who can assist me to move out this money immediately for investment .
 Based on this
 I solicited for your assistance to transfer this fund into your Account
 but I will
 demand for the following requirement:
 (1) Could you provide for me a safe Bank Account where this fund will be transferred to in your country or another nearby country where
 taxation will not take great toll on the money?
 (2) Could you be able to assist me to obtain my travelling papers after this transfer to enable me
 come over to meet you in your country for the investment of this money?
 (3) Could you be able to introduce me to a profitable business venture that would not require much technical expertise in your country where part of this fund will be invested?
 Please
 all these requirements are urgently needed as it will enable me to establish a stronger business relationship with you hence I
 will like you to be the general overseer of the investment thereafter. I am a Christian and I will please
 want you to handle this transaction based on the trust I have established on you. For
 your assistance in this transaction
 I have decided to offer you 15% percent commission of the total amount at the end of this business.
 The security of this business is very important to me and as such
 I would like you to keep this business very confidential. Upon the
 receipt of your mail
 Thank you and God bless you
 Mr Benard Gelicah Sankoh.

 Attn:Dear Friend

 I wish this my proposal will not come to you as a surprise. I am James DeSouza
 a Regional Director with NATIONAL TRUST SECURITY COMPANY S.A.R.L with regional office in Lome-Togo. We had a foreign client (Mohamed Mohd Salaheldin)who deposited a huge sum
 of amount
 US$4.5million(Four Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with our Company. Unfortunately
this client was among the victims of EGYPTAIR FLIGHT NO.990 that crashed on the 31-10-1999
 in U.S.A. Confirmable from the below website:(www.cnn.com/us/9911/02/egyptair990.list/index.html) but
 since then we have not had any body to come for the claims as the next of kin. A sitaution I have monitored closely with my position in the Company.
 Now
 having monitored this deposit and managed it over the years before his death
 and hence nobody has showed up as the next of kin for the past two years plus
 I have removed the file to my "private vault". I now solicit for your assistance to present
 you as the next of kin as every other arrangement has being concluded by me and I am only waiting for a foreigner to enable me move the funds to his account. This does not have any risk attached to it as all the internal documentations would be handled b
 y me and every loop holes sealed off.
 I therefore request you to confirm your interest by a return message and I will furnish you with the full details and what to do concerning this deal. What you stand to gain would be discussed and it is negotiable before the deal commences.
 Believing to hear from you soonest.
 Kind regards

 James DeSouza.

 Re: Urgent Assistance Needed
 By way of introduction I am Eng. Farouk Al-Bashar
 I represent my family as the oldest son of the Al-Bashar family
 who are the descendants of Ibrahim Al-Bashar Ali from one of the oil rich areas in Iraq. Over the years my family has acquired huge sums of money from royalties for the exploration of oil in our region but over the past 15 years
 Saddam Hussein and his gangs of bandits have taken our oils without payments and we can not complain as those who did are all dead. In the wake of the Gulf War of 1990
 our family withdrew most moneys that remain in coded bank accounts that Saddam did not find and we hide it in a secret chamber underground
 where it remained safe until after the war. At the end of Gulf war
 we moved the funds into a private vault of a security company in Baghdad
 where it was until we collected it a few days ago on the fear of the eminent war with America.
 We pray they remove Saddam as he is the cause of much hardship here
 but our funds are trapped here and there is no avenue to transfer any amount from Iraq without Saddam knowing. The problem now is how do we transfer the funds totalling US$12.5 Million in cash from here.
 We are afraid that with the capacity of the bombs America is coming to Baghdad with nowhere would be safe for the money
 so we need you to help in securing a private collection agency who would come to Iraq and collect the money and have them moved to the west
 where our family is planning to relocate to as life in Iraq is no longer worth living because of Saddam.
 I have to travel lots of miles each day to send an email hoping someone out there would assist this family
 if you can we will give you the details of an agency that can lift the funds from here as given to me by a US Marine. The private collection agency would then collect the fund from here and deliver it to you for safe keep. Hoping the American campaign would be successful
 we would then come over to your country
 for a meeting to share the funds and hopefully start a new life with you as a partner.
 For your assistance with this project the family is willing to give you 10% of the funds
 however if this does not suit you we are open for negotiation.
 We eagerly await your response so we can inform you of the next line of action.
 Regards.

 a director with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Contract award monitoring committee. It is with trust and confidence that I make this urgent and important business proposal to you on behalf of my colleagues . Actually
I would have contacted you by surface mail but for the urgency and the confidentiality this transaction demands hence I decided to contact you via email.
 My colleagues and I are members of the Contract Award Committee(CAC) of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). My colleagues have mandated me to look for a trustworthy company into whose account some funds is to be transferred.
 We are in our possession vital approved documents to remit the sum of Twenty-six Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (US$26
500
000.00)incurred from returns of our OPEC Oil sale which we want to transfer to a reliable safe foreign bank account in your country for our mutual benefits
 as we intend to invest into lucrative business venture
 in your country with your advice all we require from you is to provide us a safe bank account for the remittance of the fund and also to help source for lucrative long term investment to invest part of this fund.
 We are willing to offer to you upon negotiation an aggreable percentage of the total sum and profit accruing from investment plans. We are absolutely sure and positive that this arrangement will be of mutual benefit to us
 and we crave your indulgence to treat this proposal with utmost trust and seriousness. We will fly over to meet with you
 as soon as the money is transferred to your account for the disbursement of the fund and business plans
 please note that this fund in question is not an illegal money
 as all vital approved papers for the transfer will be sent to you as soon as we receive your banking information such as completed particulars of the bank account where you wish the fund to be transferred.
 The nature of your company?s business is irrelevant to this transaction
 as all arrangements have been concluded for a successful and hitch-free transaction.
 We have taken measures to ensure that there is no risk involved on both parties; we have estimated that this transaction will be concluded within 14 working days on receipt of your acceptance to this proposal. Most important to send back to me now: Your private telephone
 fax numbers: Name and address of your bank: phone and fax numbers: Your name
 company name and address: Bank account and particulars.
 My colleagues and I have had some fruitful discussion with relevant top officials of both the Federal Ministry of Finance (FMF) and Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and they have agreed to co-operate in the transfer. An application for funds transfer shall be made at the appropriate ministries in favour of the beneficiary (you or your company). Thereafter
 your company shall be officially regarded as having executed the contract for the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) for which payment is being made. This process makes the operation legal according to the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Please treat this transaction as strictly confidential
as we are civil servants who are not entitled to operate a foreign account.
 While thanking you for your envisaged co-operation.
 I await your immediate response through email address or fax.

 from-guaranty trust bank plc
 lagos-Nigeria. i want you to help or look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable and fit to provide either an existing account or open or set up new one immediately to receive this floating fund from my bank here in lagos
 even an emty account can serve to receive the money
 as long as you remain honest to me till the end of this important business transaction.
 I want to believe you will not let me down now or after the fund transfer to your account.
  I am aderoju muyiwa the audit/surpervisor
 guaranty trust bank 
 lagos-Nigeria. during the course of auditing i discorvered a floating fund in an account opened since 1993 and also since 1996 nobody has operated this account again. after going through some files in the record
 I discorvered that the owner account died without a living [Heir]
 hence the money has being floating and if i do not remit the money out urgently it will be forfeited to the goverment for nothing.
 The owner of the account Mr Allan miller
a foreigner and an industrialist
died since 1996 with his wife who is his next of kin
that is why nobody has come to ask for the money
 my investigation proved to me as well that the late Allan seaman until his death was the managing director of diamond safari  [pty] sa.
 With the particulars that you will provide
 i will change all his banking docs to yours and start the fund transfer process to your account
but first you have to give me your word that you will not let me down like i said before and also agreement signed between us.
 We will start the first transfer with six million dollars [$6
000.000.] upon succesfull transfer without any disappointment from your side
we shall re-apply for the transfer of the remaining six million eight hundred thousand united states dollards
 [$6
800.000.] into your account bringing the total to twelve million eight hundred united states dollars [$12
800.000.].
  I am contacting you as a foreigner because this money can only be approved to a foreigner with valid international passport
 drivers particulars and with foreign account because the fund is in dollars and the former owner of the account
late Mr Allan seaman is a foreigner.
 I will like us to sign a binding agreement that will bing us together in these deal
 I am revealing this to you with the believe that you will not let me down
 You are the first and only person I am contacting as regards this business
 so please reply urgenly for me to brief you on the next step to take.

I am sorry for the embarrassment this letter might cause you as we have not had any correspondence before this letter. I got your address through my nephew   with Nigerian Military Chamber of Commerce industry and Mining during my research for a reliable and trustworthy partner who l can do business with though l did not disclose the nature of the business l intend to do with whoever he recommend for me.
 I am DR. MRS MARIAM ABACHA
 wife of the late Nigeria Head of State
 General Sanni Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998 while still on active duty. I am contacting you in view of the fact that we will be of great assistance to each other likeness developing a cordial relationship.
 I currently have within my reach the sum of Twenty - Five Million US Dollars (US$25
000
000.00) cash which l intends to use for investment
 like Real Estate Development specifically in your country. This money came as a payback contract deal between my late husband and a Russian Firm on our countries Multi-billion dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant.
 "The Russian Partners returned my husbands Share of USD$25
000
000.00 after the death of my husband and Lodged in my husbands Security Company of which l am director right now
 the new Civilian Government have intensified their probe on my husband? Financial and oil company. In view of these
 l acted fast to withdraw the US$25
000
000.00 from the company vault and deposited it in a Security Company. I have since declared the Security Company bankrupt. No record ever existed concerning the money traceable by the government because there is no documentation showing that we received the money from the Russian."
 Due to the current situation in the country concerning government attitude towards my family
 it has become quite impossible for me to make use of this money within. Let me refer you to the front page of this day newspapers of 10th March 2001. You can check it through their website www.thisdayonline.com the present government in Nigeria had frozen and seized all our bank accounts both here in Nigeria and abroad.Thus consent l shall expect you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss in detail about this transaction.Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to transfer this fund
 I proposed a percentage of 30% of the total sum to you for the expected service and assistance
 15% for offsetting minor expenses incurred in the  course of this transaction. Your urgent response is highly needed as to stop further contacts. All correspondence must be by the email address mariamabacha200@ecplaza.net I will give you my Tel numbers where you can contact me when I hear from you.
 I must use this opportunity to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential whatever your decision while await your prompt response.
 NB: Because of the security being mounted on the members of my family
 l has decided that this transaction exist between you and my nephew Dr. Azeez Bello. Remember to include your private Tel/fax or mobile number for easy communication.
 Best Regards.
 DR. (MRS) MARIAM ABACHA

Dear sir

 I write to inform you of my desire to acquire estates or landed properties in your country on behalf of the Director of Contracts and Finance Allocation of the Federal Ministry of works and Housing in Nigeria. Considering his very strategic and influential position
 he would want the transaction to be strictly as confidential as possible. He further wants his identity to remain undisclosed at least for now
 until the completion of the transaction.Hence our desire to have an overseas agent.
 I have therefore been directed to inquire if you would agree to act as our overseas agent in order to actualise this transaction. The deal in brief is that the funds with which to carry out our proposed investments in your country is presently in a coded account in the Nigerian apex bank and we need your assistance to transfer the funds to your country or any safe account outside your country in a convenient bank account that will be provided by you before we can put the funds into use. For this you shall be considered to have executed a contract for the ministry. The contract sum of which shall run into US$15.5Million of which your share shall be 30% if you agree to be our overseas agent. Your area of specialisation does not matter in this transaction
 all that is required of you is a safe account and your willingness to assist us . As soon as payment is effected and the amount mentioned above is successfully transferred into your account
 we intend to use o!
  ur own share in acquiring some estates abroad. For this too
 you shall serve as our agent . It might interest you to note that last year
 a similar transaction was carried out with one MR. CHIENCHEN YU of Taiwan but after securing the payment approvals
 and payment effected
 MR.CHIENCHEN YU changed his numbers and addresses
 and was no where to be found on our getting to Taiwan.
 That was how we lost US$7.5Million. So this time around 
 I will be with you before the remmittance is made into your provided account to avoid future occurrence and allow trust to play a very minimal role until performance is seen. You are requested to communicate your acceptance or otherwise of this proposal
 through email.
 After which we shall discuss in details the modalities for seeing this transaction through. If however
 you are not disposed to assist
 kindly destroy this letter in view of the confidentiality of the proposed transaction and
 interest of the personalities involved.
 Thank you in anticipation of your co-operation.
 Best Regards

 Dr.Bola Harry.

"Difficulties encountered in efforts to establish a business abroad necessitate this search for someone to assist me in securing and investing the sum of $12.500.000 (twelve million and five hundred thousand dollars)inherited from my fathers business reserve."
 "I am the heir of a Zimbabwean family; my father was an agriculturist. He became rich from his old-aged investment in agriculture and later was victimized by  President Robert Mugabes land reform policy. He was assassinated by unknown gunmen for defending his land ownership and siding the minority white farmers. Before his death
 my father foresaw the insecurity of both our lives and properties then decided to deposit the above sum with a private finance and security firm in Europe. This money has become the only inherited property of our family since our home was burnt
and the farmlands and machines seized; yet the government and its loyalists are bent on making life difficult for us."
 To summarise this traumatic story
 my mother and I have decided to offer 15% of the above sum to anyone who assists us to secure this funds overseas or 25% share for possible help on investing in any rentable sector.
 thanks for your anticipated assistance. if you do not accept my offer

 which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor

I am by name
Hajia Mariam Sani Abacha
the former first lady and also the wife of the former late head of state of the Federal Republic
 of Nigeria
Late Gen.Sani Abacha whose sudden death came on the 8th of June
1998. Since his death
I have been thrown into astate of utter
 confusion
 frustration and hopelessness by the present civilian administration
 I have been subjected to physical and psychological torture by the security agents in the country. My son Mohammed was under detention arraigned before the federal high court of Nigeria for an offence he did not commit.Though he has been released since on the 23rd of september
2002 based on certain conditions
but he is not allowed to move around to any where.He has been restricted to his own town only and also been placed under the government watch.
 As a widow that is so traumatized
 I have lost confidence with anybody
 within the country. You must have heard over the media reports and the internet on the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited by my husband in different security firms abroad
 some companies willingly give up their secrets and disclosed our money confidently
 lodged there or many out right blackmail. In fact the total sum discovered by the Government so far is in the tune of$700.Million dollars. And they are not relenting to make me poor for life.I got your contacts through my personal research
and out of desperation decided to reach you through this medium.I will give you more information as to this regard as soon as you reply. I repose great confidence in you hence my approach to you due to security network placed on my day to day affairs I cannot afford to visit the
 embassy so that is why I decided to contact you and I hope you will not betray my confidence in you. I have deposited the sum of 40.3million dollars with a security firm abroad whose name is witheld for now until we open communication.
 I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your account for safe keeping. This arrangement is known to you and my son Abba alone
so my son will deal directly with you as security is up my whole being.I am seriously considering to settle down abroad in a friendly atmosphere like yours as soon as this fund get into your account so that I can start all over again if only you wish
but if it is impossible
just help me keep this funds in your account which will accrue you 25% of this fund. Please honesty is the watch word in this transaction.I will require your telephone and fax numbers so that we can commence communication immediately and I will give you a more detailed picture of things.In case you dont accept please do not let me out to the security as I am giving you this information in total trust and confidence I will greatly appreciate if you accept my proposal in good faith.
 Please expedite action.
 Sincerely yours

 Hajia Mariam Abacha

I am my family fled to South Africa

 Note that you will also assist us to come over to your country as soon as you claim the fund. We also intend to invest part of our share into a profitable business in your country under your supervision.

I seek your help
 attention and genuine co-operation to our mutual benefit and
 i believe that you will not let down the trust and confidence i am about to repose on you.
 "I am MR.FRED OBI
from NIGERIA and for the past ten years
I have been working in a public Relations firm that pays me about 100 hundred dollars each month. On the 30th of june
our company made a very big financial breakthrough when we made contact with ALHAJI DAN MUSA. We began to supply him his cow vaccine named LIM KXT COW VACCINE. ALHAJI DAN MUSA is THE PRESIDENT OF (WICDEL GROUP COMPANY )He is a millionaire farmer with CATTLE FARMS in all part of AFRICA 
 and a new one located at ABIDJAN COTE DVOIRE."
 Moreover
 he is the greatest supplier of cattle beef and other dairy products to the whole of West Africa.HE had informed us about the huge amount of money he spends on the purchase of a particular but very important cattle medicine. Precisely
 he buys U
 S$5
000 per carton. He asked if our organisation can source for a cheaper supplier.
 We did market research and discovered that we can buy these vaccine in Europe for US$2
000 per carton. We moved a proposal to WICDEL GROUP COMPANY
 to supply him at US$4
800 per carton which they accepted. As these supplies progressed and our company is
 doing fine
I requested to my boss for an increase in our salary.he was so upset that he sacked me without benefits and ten years of dedicated workmanship.
 I was so desperate that I went to the WICDEL GROUP COMPANY farms and infomed ALHAJI DAN MUSA that I have a foriegn contact that will be willing to supply him this same products at US$4
400. Per carton. ALHAJI DAN MUSA in turn confided to me that he is about to place order for one thousand cartons following a suspected outbreak of disease in his farms.I asured ALHAJI DAN MUSA that my foreing contact will be in the position to manufacture and supply to him
infact I convinced him that my former boss usually buy from my foriegn contact and that is why he sales to him at a higher price. HOWEVER
I INFORMED ALHAJI DAN MUSA THAT HE WILL HAVE TO PAY CASH IN ADVANCE BEFORE MY FORIEGN CONTACT WILL SUPPLY TO HIM. For the moment he has stopped all contact with my boss.
 Please consider on how to handle this profitable project and kindly contact me immediately through my private e-mail: fredobi@indiatimes.com
 for more details and negotiations as regards my commission.However
I will insist that my commission will be 20% of the total profit.
 Note : We will buy one thousand carton at US$2
000
000. We sell to them at US$4
400
000 Dollars
 our client pays cash before lifting of the goods. (They must not know our purchase point in (Europe).

I am delighted to write this letter
 hoping you will understand my predicament and answer back without hesitation since I am convince you must be an honest and God fearing fellow who will help save my life and my only son
hence our country has been frustrating us since the death of my husband.
 I am in possession of $6
500
000.00 (SIX MILLION
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND U.S DOLLARS)which I want to invest in your country. For your clarification and understanding
 this money in a security company
 which I deposited as a family effect since 6th of Febuary 2000 after the death of my husband
 is not an ill gotten wealth rather it was generated by my late husband from over twenty years of his Banking Service and business relationship.
 On your acceptance to render this assistance to me
I will contact my son to instruct the Clearing House  to effect a change of ownership of this fund in your name as the bonafide owner/my next of kin to enable you retrieve the fund on behalf of me and my
 family to your country to make good arrangement for any profitble joint business investment pending my arrival with my son to your country after you have transferred this fund.
 "Bear in mind that this transaction demands absolute confidentiality because properties
 assets and bank accounts bearing the MBEKIS family name
 are being ordered to be confiscated by the newly elected civilian President of South Africa. hence I will not want to be exposed for security reasons."
 For your knowledge
 1 % of this total amount has been set aside for all the expenses you might incure during the process of securing this fund. Example: TELEPHONE BILLS
 HOTEL BILLS
 FLIGHT BILLS
and other miscellenous expenses.
 Try and negotiate for some profitable blue chip investment opportunities which is risky free which I think we can invest with part of this money when it is transferred.Personally I am interested in estate management and hotel business
please contact my son (SODINDO M MBEKI) who was lucky to escape from South Africa to Lome-Togo with the Certificate of the claim Deposit
 where he is now staying as a refugee on his email address (sodindo@uboot.com) for detailed procedure.
 Thanks for your anticipated co-operation.

 Re: Transfer Of Usd $21
500.000{Twenty - One Million
 Five Hundred Thousand Us Dollars Only.
 I am a member of the Federal Government Of  Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (N.N.P.C).
 Sometime ago
 a contract was awarded to a foreign firm in the Petroleum Trust Fund (P.T.F.) BY MY COMMITTEE.
 This contract was over invoiced to the tune of us$ 21.5Million Dollars. This was done delibrately. The over - invoicing was a deal by my committee to benefit from the project.
 We not want to transfer this money
 which is in a suspense account with the P.T.F. into any oversea account
 which we expect you to provide for us.
 Share:
 30 % of the money would be yours
 for providing us with logistics
 which
 would include a safe bank account
 where we shall facilitate funds transfer into
 as soon as documentations are concluded over here.
 10 % of the money has been mapped out from the total sum to cover any expenses that might be incurred during the course of the transaction
 (both local and international expenses).
 If interested in assisting us
 please contact me via my secured email address
 as soon as possible (uba.jega3@caramail.com) or my secured satellite tel/fax number
 specially procured for this project.
 It may interest you to know that a similar transaction was carried out with one Mr. Patrice Miller
 President of Crane International Trading Corp.
 of 153 East 57th St.
 28th floor
 N.Y.10022
 Telephone: 212-308-7788 and Telex: 6731689. The deal was concluded and all covering documents
 forwarded to Mr. Miller to authenticate the claims. Once the funds were transferred
 Mr. Miller presented to his bank
 all the legal documents and remitted the whole funds to another bank account
 and disappeared completely. My colleagues and I were shattered
 since such opportunities are not easy to come by.
 Please
 if you are interested in assisting us carry out to the fullest capacity
 this transaction
 we would require the following information from you which would enable us make formal application to the various ministries / parastatals
 for the release and onward transfer of the money to your account.
 "1.Your Full Name
 Companys Name
 Address
 Telephone and Fax Numbers."
 2.Your Bank Name
 Address. Telephone and Fax Number.
 3.Your Bank Account Number and Beneficiary Name - You must be the signatory.
 Please
 note that we have strong and reliable connections at the Central Bank Of Nigeria and other Government Parastatals
 hence assistance in this regards
 would not be a problem.
 At the conclusion of this transaction
 we shall use same contacts to withdraw all documents used in the course of this
 to avoid any trace whatsoever that may ever arise
 to you or to us
 now and in the nearest possible future.
 It might also interest you to know that we are mere civil servants who do not want to miss this opportunity
 hence
 we want this money transferred out
 as soon as possible
 before the newly democratically elected government ever think of making enquiries as regards the various activities of the past military government.
 Kindly contact me as soon as possible
 whether or not you are interested in this deal
 so that whereby you are not interested
 it would give us more room to scout for another partner. But if you are interested
 kindly contact me via above email
 telephone or fax
 so that we can swing into action
 as time is not on our part.
 I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.

 Attn:President/Ceo.
 First
 I must solicit your confidence in this transaction.  This is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret.  I got your contact in my private search  for a reliable person to handle this  transaction. We shall base this transaction on mutual respect and honesty. Hence
it is neccessary for you to assure us of your ability  to prosecute this transaction of  great magnitude
your ability and reliability to prosecute a transaction of great magnitude involving a pending business transaction requiring maximum confidence.
 We are top officials of the Federal Government Contract Review Panel who are interested in importation of goods into our country with funds which are presently trapped in Nigeria.  In order to commence this business we solicit your assistance to enable us transfer into your account the said trapped funds.
 The source of this fund is as follows:  During the past Military Regimes here in Nigeria
 the government officials set up companies and awarded themselves contract which were grossly over-invoiced in various Ministries.  As a result the Government of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo deemed it neccessary to set up a Contract Review Panel to investigate and recommend accordingly. After a thorough investigation
 we discovered a lot of  inflated contract funds which are presently floating in the Central Bank of Nigeria.. We (members) have unanimously agreed to transfer part of these funds to a foreign account  However
 by virtue of our position as civil servants and members of this Panel
 we cannot acquire this money in our names.  I have therefore
 been delegated as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the Panel to look for an Overseas partner into whose account we would transfer the sum of US$21
500
000.00 (Twenty One Million
 Five Hundred Thousand US. Dollars).  Adequate logistics and
 strategies had been worked out to ensure a successful transfer with your maximum  co-operation. Hence we are writing you this letter.
 We have agreed to share the money thus:
 It is from this 70% that we wish to commence the importation business
 please note that this transaction is 100% safe and we hope to commence and conclude the transfer latest in ten (10) banking days from the date of receipt a reply from you indicating your willingness to assist.
 "The above information will enable us write letters of claim and job description respectively. Moreso
 we will use your name or companys name to apply for payments and re-award the contract in your name or companys name.  We are looking forward to doing business with you and solicit your confidentiality in this transaction.  Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using the this mail box .  "
 I will bring you into the complete picture of this lucrative project when I have heard from you.
 Yours Faithfully

 Sincerely yours

 MR.ODIASE GEORGE

It is a priviledge to hear from God and it gives me joy to relate my testimony to you haven recieved instruction from God through divine  revelation.
 I was a Moslem and a retired military top officer in Nigerian Army that served under the past military regime. I was the financial secretary to the Armed Force Ruling Council (AFRC). With my position as a
 "financial secretary
 I was able to divert up to $45
000
000.00 (Forty Five  million U.S Dollars
 into my personal Bank  Account
 hoping to invest the money when Im retired."
 Immediately I got retired
 I was converted from Moslem to Christian  when I was preached the words of God through my cousin Pastor Paul Osakwe. I then gave my life to Christ and became a born again Christain.
 "Since I gave my life to Christ
 I had no rest of mind. Some times I  think of the souls I killed when I was a soldier and the dubious ways I  diverted my countrys money into my Personal Bank Account.I then decided"
 to seek the face of God for forgiveness and after fasting and prayer through Divine Revelation
 the Almighty God revealed to me that the only way I could have rest of mind is when I used all my money to
 do the work of God. I immediately disclosed my revelation to my Pastor and he was happy with me.
 I have been thinking of the particular thing to do for my God before this present civilian president of my country set up  a panel  (Honourable Oputa Panel) to probe the Bank Account of the past Military officers
 like me. Instead of loosing this money to my government
 I quickly  withdrew my money out of my Account and deposited the money in a finance and security company for safety.
 My Pastor has adviced me to sneak out of the country with the money to sow it into a ministries abroad. I have decided to sow this money into  your ministry. I am making arrangement to come over to your country but
 you need to receive this in cash before I come over.
 The cash has been packaged by the security company in consignments and ready for shipment but the security company requires the address of the money from the finance and security company receiver. Please send to
 me your names
 address and your tele and fax number where I can fax the  Airway Bill to enable you claim the consignment.
 I will be coming over to your ministry with my family for thanksgiving as soon as I sent out this money to you.
 I look forward to your response through my private yahoo account:zik_don@yahoo.co.uk
 God bless you.

 Attn:
 This contact is about financial investment. I came to the conclusion of contacting you with hope that this will transpire into a more mutual relationship between you and Ifor now and in future.
 I am Mr. Nzanga Mobutu
 son of the late president Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire. As you may have read from the international media
 my fathers investments in various places like France
 Switzerland and Belgium were all confiscated and his international accounts frozen by their
 Governments.
 Now that the situation has calmed down
 there is the need for my family to invest discretely in various part of the world without our family name mentioned. It is in view of the above that I make this contact to request if you may like to be my family’s financial manager.
 The fund to be invested is the sum of 58 million U.S.D in the volt of an international bank in Accra Ghana. It is my wish that you invest this fund for us in your country and around the world by engaging into lucrative investments such as buying of shares/stocks in multinational companies
 real estate and other non-speculative investment.
 To facilitate an easy transfer of the fund
 I have arranged to move the fund to a bank in South Africa from where it will be remitted to your account.
 Upon the acknowledgement of your response
 I will arrange for a face-to-face meeting for you and I. In the meeting we shall sign a working agreement and the fund will be handed over to you for investments.
 You may reach me through kanmka@yahoo.co.uk.

 Dear Friend
 You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally. I am the first daughter of the most popular black farmer in Zimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute in my country.
  I got your contact through network online hence i decided to write you. Before the death of my father
 he took me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US$30 Million (thirty million United States dollars)
 in one of the  security company
 as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This money was deposited in a box as gem stones to avoid much demurrage from the Security Company.
 This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the Farms and establishment of new farms in Swaziland. This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe
  introduced a new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some few black farmers
 and this resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact a lot of people were killed because of this Land reform Act for which my father was one of the victims. it is against this background that I and my family fled
 Zimbabwe to South Africa for fear of our lives.
 "After which
 I traveled to the Netherlands and I am currently staying in the Netherlands where i am seeking political asylum and more so have decided to transfer my fathers money to a more reliable foreign account. Since the law of Europe prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zone of European Union. As the eldest child of my father
 I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got."
 The South African government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of my family name for fear of going through difficulty in future. Both countries have similar political history. I am seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my future and that of my family in his hands
 I must let you know that this transaction is risk free. If you accept to assist me and my family
 all I want you to do for me
 is to make arrangements with the security company to clear the Consignment (funds) from their affiliate office here in the Netherlands as i have already given directives for the consignment to be brought to the Netherlands from South Africa.
 But before then all modalities will have to be put in place like change of ownership to the consignment. I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction. Or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country. Whichever the option you want
 feel free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred in the process of this transaction.
 If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 20% of the money while the remaining 75% will be for my investment in any of the country of your choice.  while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction.
 I await your immediate reply and God bless.
 Best regards

Calvary greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
 I am former Mrs. Fatima Abass Yakubu Idris now Mrs Mary Abass Yakubu Idris
 a widow to Late Sheik Abass Yakubu Idris.
 I am 65years old; I am now a new Christian convert
suffering from long time cancer of the breast. From all indications
 my condition is really deteriorating and is quite obvious that I may not live more than six months
 because the cancer stage has gotten to a very Severe stage.
 My late husband was killed during the Gulf war
 and during the period of our marriage we had a son who was also killed in a cold blood during the Gulf war. My late husband was very wealthy and after his death
I inherited all his business and wealth. My personal physician told me that I may not live for more than six months and I am so scared about this. 
 So
 I now decided to divide part of this wealth
 by contributing to the development of evangelism in Africa
which is in my place
America Europe and Asian Countries.This mission
 which will no doubt be tasking had made me to recently relocate to Nigeria
 Africa where I live presently. 
 I selected you and your church after visiting the website for this Purpose and prayed over it
 I am willing to donate the sum of $2
200
000.00 Million US Dollars to your Church/Ministry for the development of evangelism and also as aids for the less privileged around you.
 Please note that
 this fund is lying in a Security Company in Europe and the company has branches
therefore my lawyer will file an immediate application for the transfer of the money in the name of your ministry. Please
 do not reply me if you have the intention of using this fund for personal use
than enhancement of evangelism. 
 "Lastly
 I want you/your ministry to be praying for me as regards my entire life and my health because I have come to find out since my spiritual birth lately that wealth acquisition without Jesus Christ in ones life is vanity upon vanity.If you have to die says The Lord
 keep fit and I will give you the whole of my life. May the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
 the love of God and the sweet fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you."
 I awaits your urgent reply.

  PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USED IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD.
        I am the above named person from Kuwait. I am married to Dr. Harry Jones who worked with Kuwait embassy in Ivory Coast for nine years before he died in the year
 2000.
  We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only
 four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians.Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my  matrimonial home which the Bible is against.When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of$8.6Million (Eight Million six hundred  thousand U.S. Dollars) with one finance/security company in Amsterderm Holland. Presently
 this money is still with the Security  Company. Recently
 my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three
 months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my  stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to church or better still a christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want a church that will use this fund to fund churches
 orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure  that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth.
 I took this decision because I don’t have any child that will  inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don’t want my husband’s hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don’t want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that  the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I don’t need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health because of the presence of my husband’s relatives around me always. I don’t want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible.  As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Finance/Security Company in Amsterderm Holland. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the original- beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shephard. My
 happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay  in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a chuch or christian individual for this  same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I  stated herein.  Hoping to hearing from you.

 Dear sir

 This letter may come to you as a surprise because we have not met. The decision to write you is out of a sincere desire to establish a business/mutual relationship with you. I got your contact through the international trade and commerce chamber (ITCC) in Madrid.
 "My name is Thomas Sesay Karimu
 the son of John Karimu (former secretery of state for mining and industry) who was killed and mutilated by the military junta led by Major Paul Koroma after over-throwing the elected government of President Tijan Kabba. Though
 I dont know to what extent you are familiar with events and disturbances in Sierra-Leone but it had consistent features in the BBC
 CNN news bulletins. The pressure of war drove my family out of Sierra-Leone into exile in Spain where we have been living under political asylum for three years."
 Sadly
 my mother died of cancer 4 months ago and was buried in Madrid. Prior to her death
 she gave me a certificate of a secret deposit that my father made in a security company in Europe (destination will be disclosed later for security reasons) The money $45
000
000.00 (forty-five million dollars) was deposited as family treasure. He did this with a view to converting it to his personal use at the end of the war but was killed as a result of his opposition to the rebel forces when the conflict intensified. I have however  contacted the security company to confirm the deposit and establish ownership.
 Due to the death of my mother and the continued hostility in Sierra-Leone
 I have decided to solicit the assistance of an honest and trustworthy person or company that will assist in investing the money. I cannot do it alone due to my present political status and total ignorance of the business world. You will be given a negotiable percentage of the money at the end of the transaction.
 If you are honest
 trustworthy and interested in the above proposal
 contact me immediately through my email address for more details. You must maintain absolute confidentiality in order to ensure success. Please
 indicate your personal telephone/fax numbers when replying.
 Best Regards

 Thomas Sesay Karimu.

 MUTUAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP-STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.
 I am Dr. HASSAN DIKO
the chief accountant of The Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and I head a five man tender board in charge of contract award and payment approvals.I came to know of you in my search for a reliable person to handle a very confidential transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account.
 There were series of contracts executed by a consortion of
 multinationals in the oil industry in favour of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) among which were for the following:
 1. The expansion of the pipelines network within for a crude down stream products distribution and subsequent evacuation which cost $8bUSD(8 Billion United States Dollars).
 2. Contract for the turn around maintenance (TAM) of the various refineries in the country $115 million Uited States Dollars.
 . The construction of storage tanks for petrolwum products (depots) $190 Million United States Dollars.
 The original value of these contracts were delebrately over invoiced in the sum $69mUSD (sixty nine Million United States Dollars Only) which has now been approved and is now ready to be transferred
 being that the companies that actually executed these contracts had been fully paid when the projests were officially commissioned.
 It does not matter whether your comapny did the contract or not
 the assumption is that your company won the major contract and sub-contracted it out to other companies.
 Consequently
 my colleaques and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement
 since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil service laws) from opening and or operating foreign accounts in our names. Needless to say
 the trust imposed on you at this junction is
 enormous.
 Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the ministry of finance and the central bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the fund within 14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms.
 Our assurance is that your role is risk free
I accord this transaction the legality it deserves and for mutual security of the fund
the whole approval procedures will be officially and legally processed with the name of any company you may nominate as the bonafide beneficiary of the above mentioned amount.
 Therefore
 when the business is successfully concluded we shall through our same connections withdraw all documents used from all the concerned government ministries for 100% security risk free.
 Please contact me immediately through E-mail whether you are interested in this deal or not
 if you are not
 it will enable us scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal but where you are interested send the required documents.
 Send by Email for security reasons.
 Thanks as I await in anticipation for your fullest co-operation.
 Very truly yours

 I am Mrs. Victoria Bucknor
named person from Nigeria. I am married to Late Mr. George Bucknor of blessed memory who worked with Nigeria embassy in switzerland for nine years before he died in the year 2000.
 We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both very devoted christain.Since his death I too have been battling with both cancer and fibroid problems.When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $5Million (Five Million U.S. Dollars) in a security company. Presently
 this money is still with the Security Company.
 Recently
 my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three  months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to either a church/organisation or devoted christain individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here- in. I want this church/organisation or individual to use this money in all sincererity to
 fund building church
orphanages
widows and also propagating the word of GOD and to ensure that the society upholds the views and beliefs of the holy
 bible.
 The holy bible emphasized so much on GOD benevolence and this has encouraged me to take this bold step. I took this decision because I  don’t have any child that will inherit this money
 and I don’t want my husband’s hard earned money to be misused by people I call unbelievers. I don’t want a situation where this money will be used in an unholy manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I know that after death I will be with GOD the most benevolent and the most merciful. I don’t need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health and also of the presence of my husband’s relatives around me always.
 I don’t want them to know about this development. With GOD all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply
 I will forward it to my family attorney and I will then instruct him to give you the contact of the
 Security Company. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the original- beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the christains/Muslims communities where you reside to always pray for me.
 My happiness is that I lived a life of a true devoted christain worthy of emulation. Whoever that wants to serve the GOD must serve him in truth and in fairness. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a church/organisation or a devoted christain for this same purpose.
 Until I hear from you
 my dreams will rest squarely on your shoulders.
 May the almighty GOD continue to guide and protect you.

Permit me to inform you of my desire of going into business relationship with you. I got your name and contact from the Benin Chamber of Commerce and Industry. I prayed over it and selected your name among other names due to its esteeming nature and the recommendations given to me as a reputable and trust-worthy person that I can do business with as per the recommendations. I must not hesitate to confine in you for this simple and sincere business.
 I am Mrs Floxy Page
 the legal wife of the elstwhile chief security officer to late major Johnny Page
 My Husband was the former head of the presidential guard to Mr Charles Taylor the liberia president. Before the death of my Husband
 on may 15th
2003 during an attempt by the rebels on the life of president C.Taylor
 where he was brutally injured and subsiquently rushed to the presidential hospital in monrovia where he later died.Before his death
he secretly called me to his bedside and told me that he has the sum of US$18Million dollars (Eighteen million dollars)that he used my name as his legal wife as the beneficiary and next of kin in depositing the fund with a clearing house in European country. The major reason is that the fund was deposited in a Security Company in Europe it was because of the ways the president was ruling the country
that he foresee things might go wrong with him in due course. Right now
 the rebels are at war with the !
  president and the
 "America government has asked the president to step down. I am now in cotonou-Republic of Benin as a refugee because i am being sought after by the rebels since my husband was seen as one of Taylors strong men as they want to wipe out our family. In this respect
i am honourably seeking your assistance in thefollowing ways :"
 1.To present yourselve as my beneficiary and next of kin to the fund
since i am hiding my identity from the authority to avoid them confisicating the fund or sending it back to Liberia.
 3.To make arrangement for me to come over to your country as an investor and to secure Residence permit in your county.Moreover
 I will like us to agree on what might be your compensation for your effort input after the successful claiming of this fund.You can get in contact with me through my alternative email:floxypage444@hknetmail.com after
 establishing cordial relationship.
 Anticipating to hear from you soon.
 Thanks and God bless you.

 I hope this letter will not embarrass you since we have not had any previous communication. I got your reference from your country`s trade department under private enquiry that is not related to my aim of writing you this letter and went further to have it confirmed by the Nigeria Exports Promotion Council(NEPC).
 I am Mr. Peter Okoye
 a Bank Manager of Standard Trust Bank Plc
 Lagos Balogun Branch.  I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6
 2000
 an American Oil Consultant/Contractor with the National Oil Nigeria Ltd. Mr. Robert Noel made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months. Valued at US$48
000
000.00 (Forty-Eight Million United States Dollars only) in my branch upon maturity.
 I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.  After a month
 we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the National Oil Nigeria LTD that Mr. Robert Noel died on air crash in ADC Airline going to Abuja our Federal Capital Territory. On further investigation
 I found out that he died without making “WILL”
 and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.
 I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Robert Noel did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents
 including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$48
000
000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigeria Law
 at the expiration of 5 (Five) years
 the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently
 my proposal is that I will like you to act as the next kin to Mr. Robert Noel so that the fruits of this old man’s labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials here.
 This transaction is very simple and 100% risk free
 therefore I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that an Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits
 which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the “WILL” and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate and realization in your favour for the transfer.
 A Bank Account in any part of the world
 which you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your Account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you and 10% will be for expences both parties might have incured during the process of transfering the money.Try and call me on my private number immediately you recieve this email on 234-1-7760497 or write me back on my private email address(peteoko@gawab.com) for further explanations.
 I look forward to your earlist response to my proposal.

 I am MR. MOHAMMED ABACHA the son of the late Gen. Sani Abacha
 former head of State of Nigeria who died on 8th June 1998 while in office. Since the death of my father the present Government of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo has been tormenting members of the Abachas family including family friends. All businesses and property owned by the Abachas have been confiscated by the Government and all our Bank Account in Nigeria and abroad have been frozen. A quick reference of Newsweek publication of March 13th 1999 were 88million dollars was taken from us will give you an insight of what I have gone through. After a short while I was arrested and detained in prison custody
\xa0 the government came up with a trump up charge against me and honestly speaking I have been in detention since November 1999 and I was only released on Thursdays (11-07-02) by the supreme court of Nigeria who passed judgment in my favor.
 "During the reign of my father as the president of this country
 an Aluminum Smelter Company of Nigeria (Alscom) contract was revealed. The contract was for the construction of plant
 at Ikuta Abasi in Akwa Ibom State of Nigeria
 for production of ingots and billets required as raw material for Aluminum and Allied Industries
 Reynolds Incorporated of America
 Phoenix and M&amp;F Companies of Switzerland conducted the feasibility studies. The contract was awarded to Ferrostall AG of Germany. However
 after the revaluation of the contract
 Ferrostall AG collected its own share of the increment in project cost
 while my fathers share of fifty-eight Million U.S. Dollars (US$58
000
000:00) was deposited on my name with a security company here in Nigeria for safety keep and I know that my father was planning of how to send this money abroad before his sudden death in June 8 1998. Since then the money has been with the security company up till date. This US$58M was secretly packaged in a trunk box and the certificate of deposit where on my name and is still in my possession."
 Hence all plane is to ship this money abroad through a diplomatic means without the knowledge of anybody from outside knowing my involvement in this money
 to avoid be seized due to my presently situation and also I am handicapped as what next to do since I am not conversant with international monitory policies. Hence I am contacting you as a reputable and trustworthy person
 with a well experience and able hand to help. This was to bit the security system in Nigeria Because I want you to claim the money on my behalf. I have declared to the security company that the consignment belongs to (YOU) as my foreign business partners.\xa0 Actually I got your contact from a reliable source

 I am MR. MOHAMMED ABACHA the son of the late Gen. Sani Abacha
 former head of State of Nigeria who died on 8th June 1998 while in office. Since the death of my father the present Government of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo has been tormenting members of the Abachas family including family friends.

A quick reference of Newsweek publication of March 13th 1999 were 88million dollars was taken from us will give you an insight of what I have gone through. After a short while I was arrested and detained in prison custody
\xa0 the government came up with a trump up charge against me and honestly speaking I have been in detention since November 1999 and I was only released on Thursdays (11-07-02) by the supreme court of Nigeria who passed judgment in my favor.
 "During the reign of my father as the president of this country
 an Aluminum Smelter Company of Nigeria (Alscom) contract was revealed. The contract was for the construction of plant

 Reynolds Incorporated of America
 Phoenix and M&amp;F Companies of Switzerland conducted the feasibility studies. The contract was awarded to Ferrostall AG of Germany. However
 after the revaluation of the contract
 Ferrostall AG collected its own share of the increment in project cost

 as a result of the wounds sustained

 I with my younger Brother decided to move out of Zimbabwe for the safety of our lives to South-Africa. </p>
 money out of South Africa for investment purpose. 
 I deposited the money in your name and it can be claimed by you alone with the\xa0 deposit code. your mother has all the documents. Take good care of your mother and brother."\xa0 From the above
 you will understand that the lives and future of my family depends on this money as much
 I will be very grateful if you can assist us.</p>

It is with heartfelt hope that I write to seek your co-operation and
 assistance in the context statedbelow:May I first introduce my self: I am DR.(MRS.) MARIAMABACHA
the wife of Late General Sani Abacha (formerMilitary head of state and President of the FederalRepublic of Nigeria) who died suddenly on 8th June
 1998. I got your contact through the help of my sister-inlaw that works with the Canadian Chambers of Commerce and Tourrism
due
I did not disclose to her my humble intention for a honest foreigner who will help save my life and my children. Having noted the confidence reposed on your person by
 the sponsor of the recommendation
 I became convinced of your capability and goodwill to assist me in receiving the sum of US$20 Million secretly willed in my favour by the late general (my husband).
  This money was kept in a Security Company in Amsterdam Holland and I have all documents with me as of when it was deposited in a Security Vault for safe keeping.This money has been defaced for Security reasons and also to avoid it been spent by unauthorized persons.We have been deliberating on
 how to invest this fund abroad in a confidential manner until we came to a conclusion to use it to buy houses and part of it will be used for non-speculative investments in your country.However
the current civilian administration of retired General Olusegun Obasanjo(The President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria) is
 seeking vengeance on the Abacha family because of the life prison jail sentence confirmed on him by my late husband while in office. In pursuit of this vendetta
the present Government have resolved to freeze all known assets of General Sani Abacha including properties at home and abroad and are presently embarking on to seize the various bank accounts of my husband
 "in Switzerland
UK and Australia. In fact
 the attack on our family (The Abachas) is so devastated to an extent of seizing our travelling passport
family accounts and even trying some members of our family in court for offences allegedly committed by my late husband..My first sonMohammed Abacha who was arristed and incacerated for the past 3years wasjust reliese from prison on the agreement to refund $1.5 Billion to the"
 Federal Government of Nigeria allegedly stollen by my late Husband.We arenot ready to comply to this as most of the family assets and bank accountsabroad have been Freezen by the Obasanjo regime.
 In view of this grevious threat to our Economic and personal survival
our family trustee have secretly protected the will
The Security Company has called me to do something about claiming this consignment because of the demurrage it is incurring and I told them we would come and claim it verysoon but they seriously advised me to move the fund into an overseas amount
 hence the reason why I have chosen you and hope that you will come
 to my full assistance and unlimitedco-operation.In the meantime
there is a travelling embargo on us(the whole
 family members) and our local accounts are seized. We are currently living on goodwill of people who believe we cannot be held responsible for the sins of my late husband. In view of this plight
 I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this distressed call to save me and my children from a hopeless future. And if you agree to help
 we will compensate you sincerely for your candid effort in this regard with 25% of the total amount of $20 Million US Dollars.In that case
 when the money ($20 Million) is moved into yourdiscrete account
 you will be allowed to withdraw 25% inyour favour
while 10% has been set aside for any expenses you might incur (There are demurrage to pay before the fund is sign and claimed by you.)during the process of securing this fund.
 "The remaining 65% will be invested meaningfully for my childrens future. My cousin (DR.UCHE EDWARD) has perfected arrangements with the Trust Company concerned and has been assured 100% risk free and safe operation.What I demand from you now is to arrange to visit the Finance Company where this money is being deposited and claim it as the bona-fide"
 owner.
 And in due course
 all contacts must be made through
 DR.UCHE EDWARD through his Telephone: 234-80-330-78104.
 E-mail address: ucheedward10@yahoo.com

 you for your co-operation. In view of all above

  In order to transfer out (USD 126 M) One hundred and twenty six million United States Dollars) from African Development Bank. I have the courage to ask you to look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable for this important business believing that you will never let me down either now or in future. 
 "I am Mr. Errol Marshall
 the Chief auditor of African Development Bank (ADB). There is an account opened in this bank in 1990 and since 1995 nobody has operated on this account again.After going through some old files in the records
 I discovered that if I do not remit this money out urgently it would be forfeited for nothing. The owner of this account is Mr.Smith B.Andreas a foreigner
 and a miner at kruger gold co
a geologist by profession and he died since 1994. No other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it
 the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that this company does not know anything about this account and the amount involved is (USD $126M) One hundred and twenty six million United States Dollars. I want to first transfer US$26( twenty six million United States Dollars) from this money into a safe foreigners account abroad before the rest
 but I dont know any foreigner."
 "I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money cannot be approved to a local bank here
 but can only be approved to any foreign account because the money is in us dollars and the former owner of the account is Mr. Smith B.Andreas he is a foreigner too. I know that this message will come to you as a surprise as we dont know ourselves before. We will sign an agreement
 but be sure that it is real and a genuine business. I only got your contact address from my secretary who operates computer
 with believe in God that you will never let me down in this business. You are the only person that I have contacted in this business
 so please reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step to take immediately. "
 "Send also your private telephone and fax number including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit. I want us to meet face to face or sign a binding agreement to bind us together so that you can receive this money into a foreign account or any account of your choice where the fund will be safe. And I will fly to your country for withdrawal and sharing and other investments. I am contacting you because of the need to involve a foreigner with foreign account and foreign beneficiary. I need your full co-peration to make this work fine because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner
 who has correct information of this account
 which I will give to you immediately
 if you are able and with capability to handle such amount in strict confidence and trust according to my instructions and advice for our mutual benefit because this opportunity will never come again in my life. I need truthful person in this business because I dont want to make mistake I need you strong assurance and trust. With my position now in the office I can transfer this money to any foreigners reliable account

My dear friend
 
 I am DR. Yetunde Bassey
 Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria
Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. 
 On June 6
 1999
 a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation
 Mr. Roger  Scott made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months
 valued at US$25
000
000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. 
 Upon maturity
 I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month
 we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers
 the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Roger  Scott died from an 
 automobile accident. 
 On further investigation
 I found out that he died without making a WILL
 and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Roger  Scott did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents
 including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. 
 This sum of US$25
000
000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. 
 According to Nigerian Law
 at the expiration of 5 (five) years
 the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. 
 Consequently
 my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Roger  Scott that the fruits of this old man&amp;#8217;s labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. 
 This is simple
 I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits
 which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.
 A bank account in any part of the world
 which you will provide
 will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 65% for me
 30% for you and 5% would be for settling expenses on my part and yours also for tax when the funds arrive your country. 
 There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested
 please reply immediately ONLY via any of my alternate private email addresses below otherwise I would not respond to you. 
 Upon your response
 I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.
 Please observe utmost confidentiality
 and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. I look forward to hearing from you soonest.
 Thanks and regards.
 DR. Yetunde Bassey

REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS ASSISTANCE
 After due deliberation with my children
 I decided to contact you for your assistance in standing as a beneficiary to the sum of US30.5M Thirty Million
 Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only)
 THE PROPOSAL
 SHARING PERCENTAGE
 Thanks for your anticipated co-operation and my regards to your family.
 Yours faithfully

 MRS. SUSAN SHABANGU Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy South Africa.

HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL.
 I decided to contact you by email because I feel that it is more secured and private. I am Nasser Bin Nasiri
 Director of Procurement and Contract Award with
 Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources [MPMR]. I am contacting you concerning the transfer of US$43 Million Dollars (FOURTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS)
 Sometime ago
 a contract was awarded by my Corporation
 [MPMR] to a Japanese Firm
 to carry out Turn Around Maintenance and rehabilitation work on Emirates Petroleum Products Company (EPPCO) This contract was over invoiced by us to the tune of US$43. Million {Forty Three Million United States Dollars).  Myself and my partner reached a compromise to transfer the
 fund into a Foreign bank account that will accommodate
 this fund. We have all modalities set.
 We were disappointed last time by a US Senator
 Late Paul Wellstone whom we trusted with a transaction of this nature up to the tune of $45 Million USD in 2001. They sat on our money for no apparent reason and was still holding our money until his family were killed in a plane crash last December.   We still believe
 that good people still exist in this world and we are willing to try again with you
 bearing in mind that God will all way fight for us.
 You can confirm the above transaction from Mr. Clarence Barnes
 Uncle to the Senator
 who provided the receiving bank account.  His email address is cbarnes@worldemail.com and phone 1-661-310-2112.   He is enjoying our collective money and refused to give us our share but we believe
 he shall meet his doom as Senator did.  Because of this we are afraid and we need your total trust and assurance that you must be an honest and straight forward person.  We made a costly mistake with the Senator
 by not going into agreement.
 Based on our status as senior government officials in top sensitive position of trust
 we cannot stand to claim this money ourselves without the assistance of a foreigner.  The process will not require your presence here in UAE.  I guarantee that this transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.
 We intend to share the money in the following manner: 30% for you
 60% for us and 10% will be for any expenses incured during the transfer.  Contact me immediately if you are interested for further details.  We look forward to a fruitful business relationship with you and your urgent response.
 Best Regards

 Mr. Nasser Bin Nasiri.

 Kindest attention

 I am very sorry for the informal manner in which this mail is reaching you. This is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trustworthy foreign partner. This request may seem strange and unsolicited but I crave your indulgence and pray that you take my request very serious.
 I am Mr. J. Rodney Chesson
 the first son of Late J. J. F. Chesson (Liberian Minister of Justice 1979 to 1980). On April 22
 1980
 my father along with 12 other Liberian Government officials was assassinated as a result of a military coup that toppled the government of President William
 I received information from a reliable source that described your country as being economically conducive for investment and her people as transparent and trustworthy to engaging business
 which made me to write you. As you may want to know and to make you less curious
 I got your email address from an Internet site that portrayed you in good light.
 Early this year
 Liberia rebels agitated for the removal of President Charles Taylor
 who portrayed a very good example of a bad leader. The President who needed support from prominent Liberia citizen gave me the sum of twenty-eight million United States Dollars (US$ 28M) cash (stalked in two trunk boxes) as compensation for my late father and solicited for my support. 
 I quickly made an arrangement with a courier company here in Monrovia and moved the consignment to an asset management company in Europe. I did not support President Charles Taylor because my conscience is not for sale. Some months later heavy fight broke up in Liberia
 he placed all the eligible members of my family under travel watch confiscated all our traveling documents and frozen all our account in Liberia. Later in July
 foreign troops invaded Liberia and different peace keeping meetings were held and President Taylor was advised to step down for national peace. On the 11th August 2003 President Charles Taylor flied into exile and handed over power to his Vice-President Moses Blah who is even more wicked and dangerous. He was the person that instigated Taylor to confiscated all our traveling documents and frozen all our account in Liberia. On Tuesday 14th October 2003
 Gyude Bryant took office in Liberia as the head of an interim government. Bryant
 54 was by picked b!
  y the warring factions and this step has offered Liberia a new chance to end nearly 14 years of violence. My lawyer approached him as regards releasing our traveling documents and the embargo on our bank accounts but he declined and told us that his priority is disarm fighters and pave the way for elections that is why I requested for your sincere assistance pending when a fresh election will be held here. 
 I will transfer the ownership of the consignment /boxes containing the cash to you and issue you a power of attorney through my Lawyer. With these document you will claims to the money as my proxy from the asset management company in Europe. The entire operation is risk free since it is only you and me and my Lawyer that knows the details of the money after you must have taken the money to your country where it is save my lawyer will then meet you in your country to use my share of the money for investment. Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to transfer this fund
 I propose a commission of 20% (twenty percent) of the total sum to you for the expected services and assistance.
 "Your private fax and telephone numbers are needed to enhance the speedy conclusion of this transaction (our only hope in life now) urgently. Your urgent response via the above email address is highly needed so as to stop further contact. I must use this opportunity to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extra ordinarily confidential whatever your decision while I await your prompt response. Our phone line both home and abroad are bugged. So dont call me. I will always call you at my convenient time and in a conducive atmosphere."

a country in West Africa is presently torn apart by strife and armed rebellion.These upheavals
 have led to the intervention of the American government which has insisted that the incumbent president Charles Taylor
vacate his position and allow an international peacekeeping force to act as a transitional government.
 The embattled president Charles Taylor
has been offered political asylum by the Government of the Federal Republic of  Nigeria
 and he intends to grasp this lifeline that has been provided.
 The Government of the United States of America have clearly stated their intentions to investigate the finances and financial dealings of  president Charles Taylor and have also threatened to freeze his personal accounts.
 In the light of these circumstances
My father has instructed me
 to source for a foreigner who can take possesion and control of a large portion of his personal fortune which he has amassed over the period of his regime

MANAGER CREDIT AND FOREIGN BILLS.
 UNION BANK PLC.
 My name is Bello Ali the manager
 credit and foreign bills of Union Bank Nigeria Plc. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank with account number 14-255-2004/utb/t who perished in a plane crash Korean Air Flight 801] with the whole passengers aboard on August 6
1998.
 Since the demise of this client customer
 I personally have watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds of USD$.30 m
 [Thirty million United States dollars] which has been with my branch for a very long time. On this note
 I decided to seek for a foreigner who I can present as the next of kin hence no one has come up to be the next of kin.
 And the banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more Than five years
 after which the money will be called into the bank treasury as unclaimed funds after this period. In view of this I got your contact from a business contact enquiry. Note that you do not need to have similar names with the late beneficiary. I will give you 25% of the total. Upon the receipt of your response
 I will commence on manipulating your information into the file as the next of kin and I will send you information on how we intend to actualize our objective in a legal manner.
 I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within five banking days
 after your claim is established as the certified next of kin to
 The deceased. 
 When you receive this letter. Kindly
 send me your private Tel/Fax Numbers for quick communication.
 Awaiting your favorable response.

Compliment of the day
 I JULIET UGAGA
 The daughter of late General  KuJI UGAGA of the Democratic Republic of Congo.im married with two children.
  My father was a General in the Congolese Army. In his position (My father) with the office of the presidentcy during the regime of Laurent kabila
 he was assigned on a secret mission to source and acquire arms  internationally in order to strengthen the Government forces against the rebels
 which already had the support of Rwandan and Uganda Army.
  Meanwhile
 he was still negotiating for the purchase of the arms
 he received on the 16th January 2001 news of the assassination of Laurent Kabila which force him to call off the assignment and deposited the  sum of US$12.5M
 Packed in a diplomatic case in a private security company in the Hague
 the Netherlands
 though he registered the content as precious  stones while the real content is (US12.5M) meant for the purchase of arms for  the Congolese Army. My father went home for the funeral of the late president
 but on  his arrival he was arrested
 detained and tortured
 unfortunately my  father suffer cardiac arrest and died on the 17th of March 2001. However
one  of our
 numerous visits
 my mother and I paid him while in prison
 my father  was able to reveal this secret to me and advice that we should proceed to  the Netherlands to claim the money
 he handed me all the relevant  documents that
 will enable me claim the box from the security company.Already
 I have  made my first visit to the security company and the document entitled to  clear this money is with a finance security company in Holland.
  On our arrival in the Netherlands few months ago
 we sought for  political asylum; which was granted. My mother and I are making frantic effort  on the best way to handle this money. We sought advice from an attorney who advised
 that we must seek for a trustworthy foreign business partner whom can invest this fund in a profitable venture. This we view as the best option because our refugee status dose not permit us to operate a bank account
 hence we seek your assistance and hope you could be trusted.
   Meanwhile
 I sincerely ask for your assistance to get this money through your account
 Your share for assisting us will be 25% of the totalsum
 5% will be use for upsetting all the expenses incurred in the courseof concluding this venture and the remaining 70% that will be for me and  my family. Also you stand to gain from any investment you might introduce us into after the conclusion of the transfer.
  Please keep this confidential until we finalize and get this money into your account for security reasons.

 RE-BUSINESS PROPOSAL:TRANSFER OF US$12.4M (TWELVE MILLION FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND)UNITED STATES DOLLARS AND BUSINESS INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIP. 
 Dear Friend and Partner

 "I solicit your strictest confidence in this proposal. This is by virtue of its nature as been utterly confidential and top secret as you were introduced to us through the Nigeria Chamber of Commerce Foreign Trade Division. We are top government officials drawn from the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing FMW&amp;H
 the Presidency and the Federal Ministry of Finance FMF making up the Contract Review Panel CRP set up by the present administration to review all contracts awarded by the past government."
 In the course of our work on the CRP
 we discovered grossly over-invoiced contracts which were awarded to foreign contractors. The contract have been duly executed and commissioned but leaving the contract commission US$12.4M Dollars floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of Nigeria CBN ready for payment.
 "The funds resulted from connivance between our predecessors and the foreign contractors. The contractors have been duly paid their contractual entitlement US$81M Dollars but leaving the over-invoiced funds US$12.4M Dollars in CBNs escrow account. We are therefore seeking your assistance in the transfer of these funds out of this country by providing your company name and address to be registered as a subsidiary or afilliate of the real company that executed the contract so as to effect the ballance of the funds into your account as part of the executor."
 This is necessary as we cannot use the help of a local contractor here since the job was executed by a foreign company. Hence the need for your assistance.
 All logistics and modalities are in place to ensure the smooth conclusion of this transaction within the nest 10 to 14 working days of commencement after the receipt of your company name and address as stated above including your telephone/fax numbers for better communication.
 These informations will enable us make the application and lodge claim to the concerned ministry and agency in favour of your company. It is pertinent to state here that this transaction is entirely based on trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque drawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeria corresspondent bankers around the World is going to be made in your name.
 Finally
 when the funds hits your account
 I and my associates will come over to your country for the sharing purpose as outlined categorically clear below.
 (iii)US$.4M Dollars as an abstract projections for re-imbursement to both parties for any incidental expenses that may be incured during the process of the transaction.
 If you are interested
 please write or call my direct access line above.
 I await your response in this regard.
 "Yours Faithfully
"

 Dear sir
 I am  accounting officer in foriegn accounts department in our bank.During our last auditing in our Bank
My Department came across a very huge sum of money (6.5 million dollars)six million five hundred thousand dollars
belonging to a deceased customer of our Bank a national of your country
who died in the plane crash of 31 october 1999[Egyptian airline 990] with other passengers aboard confirmable at this
WEB-SITE(www.cnn.com/us/9911/02/egyptair990.list/index.html).
 Since then I have made several enquiries to your embassy to locate any of our clients extended relatives
 this has  proved unsuccessful.After these several unsuccessful attempts
 I decided to trace his relatives over the Internet
 to locate any of his family member but of no avail.
 hence I contacted you for similarety of your name with that of our late customer. I need your assistance in evacuation of the funds left behind by our client in the Bank before they get confisicated or declared unserviceable by the Government
  because official
 financial laws here stipulate it that after five years any fund or assets deposited with bank/security firm without claim or servicing
 the money or assets will be divert to central bank as unclaime bill.
 since I have been unsuccesfull in locating the relatives for over 2 years now
 I seek your concent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased since you are from the same country so that the proceeds of this deposit valued at $6.5 million dollars can be paid to you and then you  will share me part of the money

 I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up claim we may make. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this business will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.
 You have to assure me that you will not sit on the fund when it is finally claimed.

 Attention: Dear friend

    REQUEST FOR BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP OF GREAT PROFITS
 I am HON. (DR.)OKON PHILIP
 the Director of Procurement and Contract Award at the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/ business of this magnitude
 but this is due to Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. It is with trust that I wish to contact you on this matter concerning the transfer of US$35Million Dollars.
 Sometime ago
 a contract was awarded by my Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to an International Oil Firm
 to Service
 Turn Around Maintenance and Rehabilitation Work on Kaduna Refinery and Petrochemical Company (KRPC) Plant in Nigeria. This contract was over-invoiced by us (myself and two junior colleagues) to the tune of (US$35 Million United State Dollars). Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor
 leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Key Tested
 Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide. It is based on this that some officials in my department and I have decided to establish a cordial business relationship with you
 hence my contacting you. We want you to present yourself as the Beneficiary to this fund
 so that we can release the fund into your account for safety and subsequent disbursement. We have all modalities set.
 We have been disappointed some years ago by a British
 Mr. Rick Williams whom we trusted with a transaction of this nature up to the tune of US$50Million U.S. Dollars. He is sitting on our money for no apparent reason and refused to give us our share but we believe that for his act of wickedness to us
 he will never go unpunished by God. Mr. Rick Williams still resides in London and enjoying our collective money.Because of this we are afraid and we need your total trust and assurance that you must be an honest and straight-forward person.
 As
 we are willing to try again with you believing in your good
 cooperation and Faithfullness.
 We have agreed to share the money thus:
 Please
 note that this transaction is 100% safe and risk free and we will commence the transaction from the date of receipt of the following information from you via e-mail.
 1. Your  personal telephone and fax numbers.
 numbers. Or you open a new account for this business.
 With these information
 we are going to put in application for the release of this funds (US$35M) into your account for us all. Due to our sensitive position
 we can not afford a slip in this transaction so contact me immediately through my e-email address for further information on the requirements and procedure for this transaction. It will only take four working days to conclude this business because once you send the your full name and address with your direct phone and fax number
 we shall credit your account through our Reserved Account in Europe or Asia.
 Remember that my present situation will not allow me to search for another person
 I absolutely HOLD YOU ON TRUST. Therefore we urge you to respond immediately to this my email address to enable me commence with the modalities of this transfer as we are well prepared to do this promising transaction with you and hope to continue with you in future.
 Please treat with the strictest confidentiality and utmost urgency.
 Yours faithfully

 DR. JOHNSON KENNETH

THIS IS HUMANITERIAN SERVICE THAT REQUIRES YOUR ATTENTION!
 I simply want to take this occasion to tell you about my intention to contribute toward the fight against Cholera and HIV/AIDS and I need your help as my representative overseas. I need you to receive my financial entitlements from my financiers overseas on my behalf for the fight against Cholera and HIV/AIDS and hope you would not let me down.
 It might interest you to know that in my supporting role to the Minister of Public Works here in Pretoria
 South Africa it is my responsibility to handle some very intrinsic matters for
 on behalf or with the Minister. By my duties
 it is almost impossible for any file/Contract Proposals to get to the Minister for approval
 without it passing through my scrutiny.
 By my religious status and as the South African Deputy Minister of Public Works
 I have cause to help a lot of foreign contractor-companies (mainly American) to secure the release of their entitlements from the coffers of the government of South Africa. I did this
 principally
 as a help to the concerned companies
 but in appreciation of my efforts
 most of them committed themselves to paying some handsome monetary honorarium to me. However
 because of my position as a political appointee
 it is impossible for me to collect such money immediately or even directly. Hence
 I need you to collect this money on my behalf and use it as you would be further directed for the fight against Cholera and HIV/AIDS. Of course your effort will not be in vain. You would be well rewarded for your help in this regards.
 All the money from the various companies put together is totaling amount to Eight Hundred and Fifty Five Thousand United States Dollars (US$855
000) only. The snag is that I just discovered that I couldn\t collect this money
 directly
 from these companies in my name or the name of any of my family members
 because government will investigate "why?" and "what for? Therefore
 to forestall any such problems
 I decided to contact you through this secured and private medium
 to solicit your assistance in this regard.
 If you are interested and would like to work with me for the fight against Cholera and HIV/AIDS
 I would need you to provide me with the following:
 Provide me with:
 d)Account Names.
 Then
 you do not have to provide your banking information. Simply provide me with:
 b) Contact/Mailing address
 Furthermore
 as surety for the money that would be paid to you on my behalf
 I would need a scanned copy of your International Passport or Drivers License for record purpose.
 When I receive all the aforementioned
 I will then send a working AGREEMENT between you and I
 to guide and guard this relationship.
 Once all these are sorted out
 I will notify the first company of my desire to receive my money through you and instruct them accordingly.
 In conclusion:
 I wish to draw your attention to the wise observation of Marlene Gill
 who wrote:
 As we continue to change and to mature as individuals and as a nation
 let us continue to dream that one-day
 very soon
 Cholera and HIV/AIDS will no longer devastate our nation
 that all of our young people will resort to responsible behavior and that the moral values of our forebears will once more dominate our society.
 I wish you the very best while giving my thanks in anticipation of a lasting business relationship with you.
 Kindly send the requirements as mentioned above via my private email addresses as stated.

This is for your urgent attention.  First
 I must solicit your strictest confidence as you read this letter.  Though this might come to you as a surprise since we have not met or spoken with each other before.  I plead for your understanding and tender my humble apologies if I had taken you unaware.
 My name is KEN AMOBI
 a member of the committee set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria to supervise the activities of the Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF)
 the agency that manages proceeds from the sale of crude oil in my country.  At the inception of the new democratic government in my country
 the Petroleum Trust Fund was ordered to wind up its operation to enable the new committee take over.  The former Chairman of the agency in the person of Major General Muhammed Buhari (Rtd.) was also retired.
 "In its place a new committee in which I am a member was appointed to take over and oversee the activities of the agency. The duty of the committee amongst others includes verifying all outstanding contract claims and debts with the sole objective of settling such long overdue claims.  I therefore decided to contact you directly having gotten your name and companys information from a business handbook of your country I discovered in the former chairman’s official study
 which he left behind in his office."
 Going through some of the files left behind by the former chairman
 we discovered that he has secured out of the Central Bank of Nigeria a forex release to the tune of US$25
500
000.00 for the payment of goods and services supplied by foreign contractors for the execution of KUBUWA WATER PROJECT in the oil rich Niger Delta.  He was trying to transfer the funds to a ghost company abroad when he was removed from office.  In confidence
 we know that the goods and services were not supplied but used his office to approve the payment in favour of a foreign firm with no fixed address.  He confided in me as a member of the new committee that he used his position to over invoice the contract.  After his removal from office
 this over invoiced amount is floating in the system and left unclaimed.  He has therefore requested me to help look for a foreign company into whose account the funds will be transferred.
 "I am now soliciting for your cooperation to enable us process the transfer of the funds to your account. You should provide us your companys name or any other name as long as you will be able to receive the amount.  It will be treated as one of the outstanding payments due to you on executed contract.  We will take measure to duly register your company here in Nigeria to give it legitimacy.  We need your companys name and account particulars to enable us file application for foreign exchange allocation order at the Federal Ministry of Finance.  The moment we accomplish this
 we will raise Contract Award Certificate in your companys name to show that a contract was actually awarded and executed by you. The nature of your business does not matter."
 For your participation and investing in this project
 we are prepared to concede 25%of the total sum to you.  On completion of the project
 we will commit a substantial percentage of our share into investments in your country and we will direct you on how to repatriate the balance of our share.
 I wish to state here again that confidentiality should be our watchword. If the above proposal meets your approval
 please respond immediately.
 Endeavour to furnish me with your secured private telephone and fax line for easy reach.

UNION BANK PLC
 My name is Usman Bello the manager
 credit and foreign bills of Union Bank Nigeria Plc. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank with account number 14-255-2004/utb/t who perished in a plane crash Korean Air Flight 801] with the whole passengers aboard on August 6
1998.
 Since the demise of this client customer
 I personally have watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds of USD$.30 m
 [Thirty million United States dollars] which has been with my branch for a very long time. On this note
 I decided to seek for a foreigner who I can present as the next of kin hence no one has come up to be the next of kin.
 And the banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more Than five years
 after which the money will be called into the bank treasury as unclaimed funds after this period. In view of this I got your contact from a business contact enquiry. Note that you do not need to have similar names with the late beneficiary. I will give you 25% of the total. Upon the receipt of your response
 I will commence on manipulating your information into the file as the next of kin and I will send you information on how we intend to actualize our objective in a legal manner.
 I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within five banking days
 after your claim is established as the certified next of kin to
 The deceased. 
 When you receive this letter. Kindly
 send me your private Tel/Fax Numbers for quick communication through my private email box at <a shape="rect" href="mailto:dr_usmanbello20033@yahoo.com">dr_usmanbello20033@yahoo.com</a>
 Awaiting your favorable response.

 Mon défunt père Foday Sabanah Sankoh fut chef des rebelles du (R. U. F.)
 il contrôlait toute la zone diamantifère de la Sierra Léone. Avant sa mort le 29 Juillet dernier
 il fut arrêté
 emprisonné et condamné par le gouvernement de mon pays.
 Mon père a eu l�idée ingénieuse de déposer en mon nom dans une société de sécurité et de gardiennage en République du Bénin ( Afrique de l�Ouest ) du nom de SOBECI SARL la somme d�argent de 50 millions de dollar américain. Le dépôt a été fait depuis 4 ans. Tous les documents originaux concernant ce dépôt sont en ma possession.

 Dear Prospective Business Partner

 I am e-mailing to you this business proposition having gone through your remarkable profile on the internet. Though
 this medium (Internet) has been greatly abused
 I choose to reach you through it because it still remains the fastest
 surest and most secured means for me to communicate with you at this time.
 However
 this correspondence is unofficial and private
 and it should be treated as such. Official telephone calls and fax messages to me WILL NOT be entertained for security reasons and for the success of this project. For further briefing
 you can reach me only via my private email address as stated below or through my lawyer whose contact shall be provided to you
 My name is Mr. James Nicholas. I am the chief financial controller to Mr. Charles Taylor
 the ex-president of Liberia who is presently on exile in Nigeria.  As his private financial controller
 I have access to his financial records more than any of his family members.
 Mr Charles Taylor has over $1 billion dollars outside Liberia and his family members or people around him are not aware of this. With his present notion of arrest and following his restricted movement and the recent proclamation by Zurich authority
 the U.N war crimes court and the America Government
 has agreed that all Bank account belonging to Charles Taylor should be reported and freezed.
 Presently
 I have complete information to authorize with documents for collecting /receiving $200 million from one of his financial sources in South Africa. And I need your assistance in receiving the funds in Europe on my behalf. Charles Taylor has prepared himself legally and secretly arranged with Top most Government agents to transfer the funds upon instructions.
 In light of the above
 I am seeking your cooperation to act as the authorized beneficiary of the said funds to enable us claim the funds for our mutual benefit. As you probably already aware
 Mr. Charles Taylor maybe handed over by his host country to the new Liberia Government to face trial soon hence the need for urgent attention to this matter.
 Your prompt responce to my proposal will be highly appreciated. As soon as I receive your geniue intention to cooperate with me
 I will have my lawyer provide you with the necessary details as required to enable us conclude this transaction successfully. I thank you and look forward to hearing from you shortly.
 Regards
 James Nicholas
 please reply via my private e-mail below.

 Because of charles Taylors notion of arrest
 and with the present development the security alert-ness is higher

Re: FIRST TRANSFER OF $6M [Six million] US DOLLAR
 I am jubeeg venture
 the operational manager in account management section incharge of credit and foreign bills of one of the prime banks here in South Africa. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank who perished with his whole families on
 25TH JULY
2000 CONCORDE PLANE CRASH [ Flight AF4590 ] with the whole passengers aboard. 
 There is an account opened in this bank in 1998 by this great late INDUSTRIALIST who died without a written or oral WILL attatched to the account. Since his death 
 I personally has watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds and no other person knows about this account or anything concerning it
the account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the manager of his company.
 The total amount involved is 106
000
000.00 USD.[ One hundred and six million United States Dollar ]. We wish to start the first transfer with $6
000
000.00
 [Six million] and upon successful transaction without any disappointment from your side
 we shall re-apply for the transfer of the remaining balance to your account.
 I have secretly discussed this matter with the general manager of the bank who I must involve in order to have a smooth and a successful transfer of the fund to any foreign bank account which you are going to nominate. On this note
 I decided to seek for a reliable foreigner who will act as the foreign beneficiary of the fund from the deceased by providing
 his/her bank account where the fund will be transferred for immediate investment on any viable project as no one has come up to be the next of kin.
 The banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than six years without claim hence the money will be recalled to the government treasury as unclaimed after this long period of domancy. 
 In view of this I got your contact through my personal search to see if you can assist by providing your safe bank account for the transfer or find a reliable person who will be capable of receiving such amount in his or her personal account.At the conclussion of the
 transfer 65% of the fund will be for me
 I will give you 20% of the total transfer sum
 10% for charity both in Africa and in your country while the remaining 5% will be set aside to settle expenses both parties might incure during the transfer process.
 Upon the receipt of your reply
 I will send to you a detailed information about the transaction. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is 100% risk and trouble free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer
 can be finalized within 7 to 9 banking days
 after you apply to the bank as the beneficiary of the fund from the deceased. 
 When you receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail or you can call me or fax me VIA:

 your private fax and phone numbers for easy and safe communication.</p>

Good Day my dear friend
 
 I wish to request for your assistance in a financial Transaction
 I decided to contact you
 based on a certain issue that is of paramount importance to me.
 But most importantly
 I want you to show your credibility promise that you will be honest and trustworthy to me during my relationship with you
 I am

 a first year medical student at the University of Ghana
West Africa. 
 on the 27th of November 2002

Ya-Naa
 YAKUBU ANDANI II .WELL YOU CAN FIND OUT BY YOURSELF THROUGH(www.bbcafrica.com) search event on the(regicide in dagbon region of GHANA) . Fortunately for me
 I was in school when the attack took place.
  I equally lost my only sister to the"ABUDU MUBS".When I got home for the remains of my parents
I discovered a document indicating that my late father had deposited $17.7M United States Dollars (Seventeen Million Seven hundred thousand USdollars) in a private security firm in JOHANNESBURG. This money
 according to the document
 was meant for the building of an ultra modern hospital for me by my late father
 when I complete my studies.
 Upon the discovery of this document 
 I left GHANA in trace of the private security firm
 and the safer of my life to make claims for the mentioned money as the only surviving next of kin to my father. But deliberately
 I have decided to keep all my uncles and Aunts out of the issue as none of them will be happy to know I am in possession of such money and decided to invest it with you in your country. 
 I have succeeded in making the people at the security company to believe that I am the next of Kin and all the documents related to it are now with me. 
 I do not know what to do with it but I have decided to contact you to seek your assistance in helping me to take it out to your country or through your account and help me to come to your country to continue my education
 so that you will help me to get the money invested until such a time that I will be ready to be in need of it. I am really desperate as I am left alone now in the world. Most importantly
 I seriously appeal that you maintain high level of secrecy and confidentiality with the whole transaction.
 Thanks and may Allah bless and guide you. more details awaits your urgent response.

 You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally.I got your contact through network online hence decided to write you. I should have notified you about it at least for the sake of your integrity. Please accept my apology. The purpose of my letter is to seek for foreign assistance with regards my late father money. My name is Laurent Nkono
 the first son of\xa0 Nkono Banjul 
one of the most popular black farmer in Zimbabwe who was recently murdered in the land dispute in my country.
 This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe introduced a new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some few black farmers
 and this resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact a lot of people were killed because of this Land reform Act for which my father was one of the victims. . It is against this background that
 I and my family fled Zimbabwe for fear of our lives and are currently staying in the Netherlands where we are seeking political asylum.
 Before the death of my father
 he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US8.5 million (Eight million
 Five Hundred thousand United States dollars)
 in one of the private security company
 as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe this money was deposited in a box as gem stones to avoid much demurrage from security company. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the Farms and establishment of new farms in Swaziland. 
 "Now the family have decided to transfer my fathers money to a more reliable foreign account. since the law of Netherlands prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zone of Netherlands
 As the eldest son of my father
 I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got. The South African government seems to be playing along with them hence I am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of South Africa for fear of going through the same experience in future and as you are aware both countries have similar political history. As a businessman
 I am seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my future and that of my family in his hands
 I must let you know that this transaction is risk free. Due to my current status in the Netherlands My lawyers shall work on my behalf to complete this transaction with you."
 If you accept to assist me and my family
 all I want you to do for me
 is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the consignment(funds) from their affiliate office here in the Netherlands as I have already given directives for the consignment to be brought to the Netherlands from South Africa. But before then all modalities will have to be put in place like change of ownership to the consignment and more importantly a concrete arrangement for the investment of part of the funds thereafter the clearance from the Security Company. 
 I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to have your percentage of the money immediately after the funds hit your account
 or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country. Whichever the option you want
 it is opened for negotiation. 
 I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred in the process of this transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 15% of the money while the remaining 80% will be for my investment in your country. Please contact me as soon a possible via the above email address
\xa0 while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction.
 Yours Faithfully

my name is aishatu ahmed.my father was recently murdered in tripoli as a result of family and friends conflicts due to a substantial amount he made while he was in the ministry.generally
most rich men keep such fund at their homes as it is illegal for one to keep such amount in any bank in lybia without a proper explaination as per how such fund was made .so these wicked people thought that this fund was still in our mansion and they tried to eliminate all our house hold in order to get free access to our home to search for it  unknowing to them that my late father had already moved the fund to a finance house in europe through diplomatic means leaving me as the beneficiary as if he forsaw the danger in our family.just one week after his burial
these people broke into our home with gun shots everywhere which resulted to the death of my only little brother.that very night
i and my mother escaped and ran to a country(by road) called burkina faso where we ar!
  e for the moment in a hidden hotel.i got your contact from a consultancy firm here in burkina faso
though i did not let them know my main reason of contacting you for confidential sake as i only told them that i needed your contact for pen pals.i need your faithfully and confidential asistance to get this fund from the finance house in europe as we are financially down due to our unprepared journey to this place
ofwhich we left all our belongings and other valuables for our dear lives hoping to get this money out of the finance house.luckily for us
we came here with all the documents relating to this fund.if you have any question to ask
please feel free to do so and get back to me soonest.

 as long as you will remain honest to me till the end for this important business trusting in you and believing  in God that you will never let me down either now or in future.
 I am DANIEL TUNDE
 the Auditor General of a bank in Africa
 during the course of our auditing I discovered a floating fund in an account opened in the bank in 1995 and since  1998 nobody has operated on this account again
 after going through some old files in the records I discovered that the owner of the account died without a [heir] hence the money is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. the owner of this account is Mr. Frankline Sullivan
 a foreigner
 and a sailor
 and he died
 since 1998. and no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it
 the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that Frankline Sullivan until his death was the manager Sulliv Coy.(pty). SA.
 We will start the  first transfer with Twenty six million [$26
000.000] upon successful transaction without any disappoint from your side
 we shall re-apply for the payment of the remaining  rest amount to your account.
 "The amount involved is (USD 126M) One hundred and Twenty Six million United States Dollars
 only I want to first transfer $26
000.000 [Twenty Six million United States Dollar from this money into a safe foreigners account abroad before the rest
 but I dont know any foreigner
 I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local person here
 without valid international foreign passport
 but can only be approved to any foreigner with valid international passport or drivers license and foreign a/c because the money is in us dollars and the former owner of the a/c Mr. Frankline Sullivan is a foreigner too
 [and the money can only be approved into a foreign a/c."
 However
 we will sign a binding agreement
 to bind us together I got your contact address from my secretary who operates computer
 I am revealing this to you with believe in God that you will never let me down in this business
 you are the first and the only person that I am contacting for this business
 so please reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step to take urgently. Send also your private telephone and fax number including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit.
 I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and to sign a binding agreement that will bind us together before transferring the money to any account of your choice where the fund will be safe. Before we fly to your country for withdrawal
 sharing and investments.
 I need your full co-operation to make this work fine. because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account
 which I will give to you
 upon your positive response and once I am convinced that you are capable and will meet up with instruction of a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in this business.
 I need your strong assurance that you will never
 never let me down.
 "With my influence and the position of the bank official we can transfer this money to any foreigners reliable account which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your country for sharing. The bank official will destroy all documents of transaction immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any place and to build confidence you can come immediately to discuss with me face to face after which I will make this remittance in your presence and three of us will fly to your country at least two days ahead of the money going into the account."

 60% will be for me
 while 5% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during the process of transferring.
 I look forward to your earliest reply through my email
 Sincerely

 DANIEL TUNDE.

 For The Attention of: OWNER / CHIEF EXECUTIVE
 This is for your urgent attention.  First
 I must solicit your strictest confidence as you read this letter.  Though this might come to you as a surprise since we have not met or spoken with each other before.  I plead for your understanding and tender my humble apologies if I had taken you unaware.
 My name is KEN AMOBI
 a member of the committee set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria to supervise the activities of the Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF)
 the agency that manages proceeds from the sale of crude oil in my country.  At the inception of the new democratic government in my country
 the Petroleum Trust Fund was ordered to wind up its operation to enable the new committee to take over.  The former Chairman of the agency in the person of Major General Muhammed Buhari (Rtd.) was also relieved of his position as the chairman.
 "In its place a new committee in which I am a member was appointed to take over and oversee the activities of the agency. The duty of the committee amongst others includes verifying all outstanding contract claims and debts with the sole objective of settling such long overdue claims.  I therefore decided to contact you directly having gotten your name and companys information from a business handbook of your country I discovered in the former chairmans official study
 which he left behind in his office."
 Going through some of the files left behind by the former chairman
 we discovered that he has secured out of the Central Bank of Nigeria a forex release to the tune of US$25
500
000.00 for the payment of goods and services supplied by foreign contractors for the execution of KUBUWA WATER PROJECT in the oil rich Niger Delta.  He was trying to transfer the funds to a ghost company abroad when he was removed from office.  In confidence
 we know that the goods and services were not supplied but used his office to approve the payment in favour of a foreign firm with no fixed address.  He confided in me as a member of the new committee that he used his position to over invoice the contract.  After his removal from office
 this over invoiced amount is floating in the system and left unclaimed.  He has therefore requested me to help look for a foreign company into whose account the funds will be transferred.
 "I am now soliciting for your cooperation to enable us process the transfer of the funds to your account. You should provide us your companys name or any other name as long as you will be able to receive the amount.  It will be treated as one of the outstanding payments due to you on executed contract.  We will take measure to duly register your company here in Nigeria to give it legitimacy.  We need your companys name and account particulars to enable us file application for foreign exchange allocation order at the Federal Ministry of Finance.  The moment we accomplish this
 we will raise Contract Award Certificate in your companys name to show that a contract was actually awarded and executed by you. The nature of your business does not matter."
 For your participation and investing in this project
 we are prepared to concede 30%of the total sum to you.  On completion of the project
 we will commit a substantial percentage of our share into investments in your country and we will direct you on how to repatriate the balance of our share.
 I wish to state here again that confidentiality should be our watchword. If the above proposal meets your approval
 please respond immediately.
 Endeavour to furnish me with your secured private telephone and fax line for easy reach.
 KEN AMOBI

Greetings

     You might be surprise to receive this mail but I will appreciate you read it carefully before responding or commenting
 I hope at the end it will find you and your business in the best of interest. Let me quickly introduce the reason and myself why contacting you is very important. I am Kalister Maunda; a senior staff at the Office of the Minister of Petroleum Affairs in Angola. I have traveled along side with the Minister of Petroleum to your country in search of investors that would be interested to invest on our Petroleum Sector
 it was in one of this trip that I was opportune to realize that the trips been made by the Minister is not for the search for an investor but for the search for what he will invest part of the Money made from Angolan petroleum sector that he has diverted to be his own. I was shocked at this discovery
 but I later realized that I was the only one among other top staffs that was not aware of these happenings
 investigation into this matter made me to know that even the president is involved. I suddenly realized that the BBC and the Excite news achieve below is true.
 http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2546281.stm
 http://apnews.excite.com/article/20040113/D8023NJ01.html
 On arrival from the trip I made with the minister and went straight to confront my Head of Department
 of my findings and he told me that he is aware of the whole situation
 he went further to show me some documents that was used to withdraw some millions of American Dollars that was meant to be used to pay Oil contracting Firms in Angola
 he said I should assist him in the search for a reputable and trust worthy business man that can assist us in transferring the funds to a safe place where it will be used for Future Investment.
     I am therefore asking for your opinion on this issue
 will you be able to assist us in transferring and claiming the money of which some percentage of the total amount involved will be granted to you for assisting us and for the time you spent on the transaction.
     If you are willing and capable to assist us kindly provide us with details of how we can reach you by phone or by fax so that we can proceed to conclude this transaction.
 Yours Truly

 Kalister Maunda [MISS]

My name is Mohammed Hamid
 I am from Iraq. My cousin was a top officer in the former Government of Sadam Hussein. Before the beginning of the war he gave me 75
000
000.00 (Seventy Five Million United States Dollars) to keep for him.
 I managed to move the box containing the money out of Iraq through diplomatic immunity to a Security company in London 
 U.K  and the box is been deposited as family treasure
 for security reasons. Now that the war is over I want to move the money to your country for safety reasons. Be rest assured that this transaction is risk free as no person is aware of this money. 
 You will be compensated with 25% of the total sum
 if you can assist. Expecting your urgent reply via mohammed@fsmail.net   .

REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS ASSISTANCE
 After due deliberation with my children
 I decided to contact you for your assistance in standing as a beneficiary to the sum of US30.5M Thirty Million
 Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only)
 THE PROPOSAL
 This fund emanated as a result of an over-invoiced contract which he executed with the Government of South Africa. Though I assisted him in getting this contract but I never knew that it was over-invoiced by him. I am afraid that the government of South Africa might start to investigate on contracts awarded from 1990 to date.If they discover this money in his bank account
 they will confiscate it and seize his assets here in South Africa and this will definetely affect my political career in Government.

I am Mr. Fred Mende
 Provincial Director Standard Bank of South Africa
 Johannesburg Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.
 On June 8
 1999
 a foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the South Africa Mining Corporation
 Mr. Richard Moss made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months
 valued at US$25
000
000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity
 I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month
 we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers
 the South Africa Mining Corporation that Mr.Richard Moss died from an automobile accident. On further investigation
 I found out that he died without making a WILL
 and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.
 I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Richard Moss did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents
 including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$25
000
000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South Africa Law
 at the expiration of 5 (five) years
 the money will revert to the ownership of the South Africa Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.
 "Consequently
 my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Richard Moss so that the fruits of this old mans labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple
 I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of two Attorneys for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you."
 There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested
 please reply immediately via the private email address below. Upon your response
 I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. 
 Please observe utmost confidentiality
 and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.
 Awaiting your urgent reply via my email:fredmende4@rediffmail.com
 Thanks and regards.

Dear Sir

 I know this mail may come as surprise to you
since we do not know ourselves or have any previous contact before now
my purpose of writting you is this.
 We believe that you would be in a position to help us in our bid to transfer the sum of twenty-seven million five hundred thousand dollars ($27.5m)into a foreign account.
 We are members of a special committee for budget and planning of the ministry of petroleum
this committee is principally consern with contract appraisals and approvals in order of priorities as regards capital project of the federal government.
 With our positions
we have successfully secured for ourselves the sum of twenty-seven million five hundred thousand united state dollars ($27.5m).
 The present government in my country are seeking the surport of foreign government
so they gave directive to all federal parastatals to compile and settle all foreign contractors being owned for contract that has been executed
so our plan is to include the name that you will provide us
as one of the contractors being owed in my corporation
the nigerian national petroleum corporation (NNPC)
 What we need from you is (1)a company name or a name of which to use as the company that did execute the contract (2)an account even if empty into which the fund will be transfered into
this is because our code of conduct prohibit government officials from operation or owning foreign account.
 It has been agreed that the owner of the account will be compensated with us$8.3 million of the remitted funds
we will keep us$16.5million
while us$2.7 million has been set aside to offset expenses and pay the necessary taxes.
 It may also interest you to know that two years ago similar transaction was carried out with one Mr George Brooks of ( BROGE INTERNATIONAL TRADING CORPORATION) at number 135
 east 57th street
 28TH floor
new york 10022 with telephone (212)308-7788 and telex number 6731689
after the agreement between both partners in which he was to take 25% of the remitted fund (fifteen million united state dollars $15.000.000.)was duly transferd into his account only to be disappointed on our arrival in new york as we were told that Mr Brooks was no longer on that address
while his telephone number had been re-allocated to somebody else
that is how we lost our money to Mr Brooks.
 This time around we need a more reliable and trusted person or a reputed company to transact this project with hence this proposal to you
so if you can prove yourself to be trustworthy ready to partake in this project then we are prepare to do business with you.
 What we need from you is the assurance that you will let us have our share after the transfer of the fund ($27.5million)into your account.
 If this proposal satisfies you
please contact me through this private email address (mansurahmed@sify.com
so we can advice you on modalities of the transaction
and note that all modalities has been worked out and once started will take two weeks with the absolute support of all conserned.
 note that this transaction is 100% risk free and totally safe now or after the fund transfer to your account.
 Please treat as urgent and confidential as i look forward to your reply.

Greetings from Mrs. M. Abacha

 "l am sorry for the embarrassment this my letter might cause you as we have not had any correspondence before this letter. I got your contact address through your countrys embassy and high commissions here in Lagos Nigeria
during my research for a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who i will do business with
 though l did not disclose the nature of the business l intend to do with whoever they will recommend for me for security reasons. "
 I am MRS MARIAM ABACHA (A Moslem)
 wife and the widow of the late Nigeria Military Head of State
 Late General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June
 1998 while still on active duty. l am contacting you in view of the fact that we will be of great assistance to each other likeness developing a cordial business relationship.
 "l currently have within my reach the sum of Twelve Million US Dollars (US$12
000
000.00) cash which l intend to use for investment purposes
 like Real Estates Development specifically in your country. This money came as a payback contract deal between my late husband and a Russian Firm on our countries multi-billion dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant.  The Russian Partners returned my husbands share of  USD$12
000
000.00 after the death of my husband and lodged in my husbands security company of which l a director. Right now
 the new Civilian Government headed by president olusegun obasanjo have intensified their probe on my husbands financial and oil company. In view of these
 l acted fast to withdraw this US$12
000
000.00 from our  companys vault and deposited it with another Security Company for safe keeping. l have since declared our Security Company bankrupt. No record ever existedconcerning the money traceable by the government because  there is no documentation showing that we received this money from our Russian business partners."
 Due to the current situation in the country concerning government attitude towards my family
 it has become quite impossible for me to make use of this money within. Let me refer you to the front page of (BBC World News of 12th August &amp; 4th September 2000). You can check it through their contact website at
 http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/africa/newsid_909000/909972.stm
 and
 http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/africa/newsid_877000/877113.stm
 The present civilian government in Nigeria had seized and frozen all our bank accounts both here in Nigeria and abroad. Thus consent l shall expect you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss in detail about this transaction. Bearing in mind that your assistance is highly needed in proceeding to the Security Company and claim this fund for onward invesment in your country. l proposed a percentage of 30% of the total sum to you for the expected service and assistance
 5% for offsetting all minor expenses incurred in the course of this Transaction. Your urgent response is highly needed as to stop all further contacts. 
 "All correspondence must be by my private email address above. I will give you my particulars including my personal picture for you to know me very clearly when l hear from you. I must use this opportunity to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence and keep this matter extra ordinarily confidential whatever your decision while awaits your prompt response. I will also scan and send to you a copy of my photograph for your record keeping. Pls Note that some times to come
You might receive some messages that looks like this but you dont need to respond back to such messages because they are ikely to be our family enemies and impersonators who are trying to know the current  financial strenght of my late husband. (Sani Abacha)."
 NB: Because of the security being mounted on the members of my family by the present civilian government headed by president olusegun obasanjo
 l have decided that this transaction transaction will exist between you and my family Attorney and also my son
Abba Abacha
 Therefore you can contact my son through our contact telephone numbers at: 234-80-33464921. Remember to include your private telephone
 fax and mobile numbers for easy communication. Kindly get in touch through my email address at: partnerindeed@voila.fr

 it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal I want to assure you that my partners and myself are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong Assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matter
 because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this business.

My name is Dr.Frances Omereme

 Since the death of this customer
 I personally have watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds of us$15.5m (Fifteen Million
 Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) which has been with my bank for a very long time before I gave the authority to moved the funds to our corresponding bank called Swiss Trust Bank Plc London branch in order not for Nigeria currupt government officials get rude of the funds. On this note I decided to seek for whose name shall be used as the next of kin as no one has come up to be the next of kin.
 In view of this I got your contact through my country`s foreign trade mission after I was convinced by providence that your name could be used as the next of kin. The request of the foreigner as a next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Nigerian cannot stand as the next of kin
 to a foreigner.
 I agreed that 30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner in respect of providing a new bank account or we can use your old account information
 while the rest will be for me
 thereafter
 I will visit your country for disbursement as I am almost due for retirement.
 Therefore
 to use my good office to facilitate the immediate transfer of this fund from our corresponding bank in London into your account as arranged
 you must apply first to the bank in London as a relation to the deceased indicating your private telephone number
 and fax number for easy communication and location where the money will be remitted. Upon the receipt of your reply
 I will send you by fax or e-mail the application and the next step to take.

I know that this proposal letter might be a surprise to you
 but do consider it as an emergency.In a nutshell
I am Mr.SAMSON KONATE MANI
from the republic of Sierra-Leone in west Africa
now seeking political asylum in Dakar Senegal under the (UNHCR).I got your contact from a reliable chamber of commerce.
 "My (late )father (Dr.MUSTAPHA MANI) was the managing director of Rainbow Gold Diamond Mining company in (KEN EMA) Sierra- Leone.But was killed during the longing civil war and all his properties was totally destroyed.However
 we managed to escape with some of my fathers precious Diamonds which is presently deposited safely in a security and finance company here in Dakar."
 Now we are saddled with the problem of securing a trust worthy foreign personality to help us transfer the diamonds over to his country pending my arrival to meet with him.Furthermore
we only want this done this way because your country is politically stable for any profitable investment and if you accept our proposal
you will serve as the beneficiary of the diamonds.
 I am giving you the offers as mentioned with every confidence on your acceptance to assist us
we have decided to give you 10% out of the total money generated from the sales of the diamonds.Secondly
we shall mapped out 2% for any miscellaneous expenses that you may incur during the transferring of the diamonds over to your country. Finally
the diamond weight in question is 42.550 Carats.Conclusively
i wish you send me a reply immediately as soon as you receive this proposal
 so that we shall arrange on how to lift this consignment out of Dakar Senegal to your country.
 On commencement
this transaction will take (7) working days to be accomplished.A certificate of ownership
 and the Lab-test result certificate of the diamonds would be fax to you immediately i receive your urgent and positive reply.Until then
i remain with the best regards. My alternative email address is (samson.mani@caramail.com)
 Regards.
 SAMSON.

This letter may come to you as a surprise but I really prayed to God to help me choose somebody that will be my true partner. 
 My name is James Nandu Savimbi.I am the first son of Mr. Jonas Savinbi
 the leader of the UNITA movement in Angola. May be you know that my father was killed recently in Angola by the Angolan Government soldiers and he has since 
 been buried. 
 Two weeks before he died (May be he knows he will die)
 he called me and showed me a box containing US$20 million and some Diamond value about US$15 million. He sent the box to a security company in Europe for safe keeping with a false name. 
 He give me the certificate of deposit and the code number. With that I can collect the box anytime I want. Now that my father is dead and I need the money to take care of the family left behind of about two wives and six children. 
 I am now hiding as the government of Angola is desperately looking for me to assasinate and also the former commander of my father wants to get me at all cost.Also
 I have to be very careful of my movement hence my search for you to help me to get the box and keep it until I can escape and meet you and you will also help me to invest the money in your country or where it is good. 
 "I will give provide you with all the power(necessary documents) to collect the box on my behalf when you tell me in your reply that you will help me and I can trust and count on you. I dont trust anybody in Angola and with the certificate and the code which I will give you
 there should/will be no problem in collecting the box. "
 "You dont have to worry
as this is 100% risk free to you as only me
 my dead father and the security company in Europe knows about this box. "
 But I want you to keep this secret as there are some enemies of my father scattered all over the whole World who are friends to the government of Angola. The name of the country where the box is in Europe and how much I will give you for help shall be revealed upon your response to my mail. 
 1 YOUR FULL NAME 
 2. YOUR CONTACT (HOME)ADDRESS 
 3. YOUR TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBER 
 4. YOUR DATE OF BIRTH &amp; YOUR OCCUPATION 
 I await your quick answer and sorry for poor english if there is any. 
 Thank you. 
 James Nandu Savimbi. 

I am Memuna Mousa from Kuwait. I am married to late Moulla Abass mousa of blessed memory who worked with kuwait embassy in Sudan for twelve years before he died in the year 2000.
 We were married for eleven years without a child. he died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both devoted Muslims. Since his death I too have been battling with both Cancer and fibroid problem.
 When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of ($10.5million (TEN MILLION
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND U.S DOLLAS) with a Bank somewhere in Europe. Recently
 my doctor told me that i would not last for the next six months due to cancer problem. Though w
 hat disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to either a Muslim organization or devoted Muslim individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instructs here in.
 I want this muslim organization or individual to use this money all sincerity to fund mosques
 orphanages
 widows
and also propagating the word of ALLAH and to ensure that thesociety upholds the views and belief of the Holy Quran. The Holy Quran emphasiz
 "es so much on Allahs benevolence and this encourage me to take the bold step."
 "I took this decision because I dont have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are new christians converts and I dont want a situation where this money will be used in an Unholy manner. Hence the reasons for taking this bold"
 decision. I know that after death I will be with Allah the most beneficent and the most merciful.
 "I dont need any telephone communication in this regard becasue of my health and becasue of the presence of my husbands relatives around me always. I dont want them to know about this development. With Allah all things are possible. As soon as I receiv"
 e your reply I shall give you the contact of the Bank where the money was deposited. I will also issue you a power of Arttorney to the Bank authorizing them that the said fund have been willed to you and a copy of such authorization will be forwarded to 
 you. I want you and muslim community where you reside to always pray for me.
 My happiness is that I lived a true devoted muslim life worthy of emulation. Whosever
 that wants to serve Allah must serve him in truth and in fairness. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your rely will give room in sourcing 
 for a Muslim organzation or a devoted Muslim for this same purpose.
 Until I hear from you
 my dream will rest squarely on your shoulders.May the Almight Allah contiune to guide and protect you.You can also reply to me through the alternative E-mail: memunamousa@survivormail.com

 the Sierra Leone mining coop. Was one of the target looted and it was destroyed. My father including other top Government functionaries were attaked and killed by the rebels in November 2000 because of his relationship with the civilian Government of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
 "As a result of my fathers death 
 and with the news of my uncles involvement in the air crash in Januaryit dashed our hope of survival. The untimely deaths caused my mothers heart failure and other related complications of which she later died in the hospital after we must have spent a lot of money on her early this year . Now my 18 years old sister and myself are alone in this strange country suffering without any care or help. Without any relation

because the cancer stage has gotten to a very bad stage."
 My late husband was killed during the invasion of collition forces from American and Britain in Iraq
unfortunately he died leaving behind a huge sim of money in the vault of a private security company oversea to be precise in Holland
 but due to
 my present bad condition of health as I am suffering from Cancer of the breast its quite impossible for me to travel that distance to receive this money.
 To this effect I have writen a letter throgh my family lawyer requseting for the transfer of this box to Dubai United Arab Emirates pending when I can succeed in getting a trust and
 reliable person to utilize this money. Although
 today
 I have a signal from Dubai notifying me of the arrival of the consignment in their security costody.
 Atleast had it been that during the period of our marriage we could produce any child
 my late husband was very wealthy and after his death
 his offspring will inherited all his business and
 wealth.I got your contact through a desperate and personal search on the web
 for someoneI could really trust and I have prayed over it.
 "Therefore my desire now is to contribute this wealth to the propagation of islam and in assisting the less-privileged Muslim faithful in Africa
Asia
Europe and in all Arab-Nations ."
 I have discussed this with my Family Lawyer hence I am willing to donate the sum of US$16
250

 "For that
 my lawyer will file applications that will back you up for the transfer of the money in your name as the beneficiary only if you promise to use this funds judiciary for"
 the said purpose.
 while 30% will be retuned back to me through my lawyer so that I can offset my bills in the hospital because of the cancer treatment.

 ATTN:Sir/Madam
 I know you will be surprised to hear from me
 but please consider this as a request from family in dire need of assistance.I am Mrs.Monica Yangani
 writing to you from Government Reserved Area (GRA).I got your contact information from the Republic of Congo Chamber of Commerce and Industry. When I was searching for a reliable individual or private company that can assist me to transfer a reasonable amount in a safe account abroad on behalf of my late husband
 two sons and two daughters. I decided to solicit your assistance to transfer this sum of US $20 Million (Twenty Million
 United States Dollars)inherited from my late husband in to your personal company’s account or private account.Before his death
 he was a Brigadier in charge of arms and ammunition procurement for the (DRC) army. In his WILL?he specifically draws my attention to this US$ 20 Million which he deposited in a safe box in Private Security Company in South Africa. \xa0During the war
 he was very dedicated and committed to winning the war against the rebels until when he found out that some Senior Army Officers and Government Functionaries were busy helping themselves with government funds and properties and sending them toforeign countries. Due to this
 he and his former special advisers to the president were assigned by the President (Laurent Kabila) to purchase arms in South Africa
 they saw this as a golden opportunity and diverted the money and divided it and he got a total sum of US $20 Million. He deposited the box in my son’s name and him alone with the deposit code canclaim it.
 Further information and arrangement will commence as soon as trust
 confidence and good relationship will be established and safety of this fund assured when transferred to your account.Please treat this matter with utmost urgency.May Allah (God) bless you as I earnestly hope for your
 assistance.

 Monica Yangani (for the family)

 MR SOLOMON MUDANI.

I know this message will come to you as a big surprise because we have not met before
 but please do not think this is one of those junk emails you received in your email box this is for real. 
 I am Rahim Sule I am the personal assistant to the late Mr. Alexander Murphy .my late boss Mr. Murphy spent all his live here in Lagos Nigeria. He is one of the richest contractors based in Nigeria before he died on 10th Jan 2000 together with his only daughter Kimberly in a motor accident. 
 the reason I am telling you these is because since Mr. Murphy died
 a lot of letters and faxes has been coming to me the personal assistant to inform the next of kin to the late Mr. Murphy for the collection of $15 million united states dollars (fifteen million united states dollars) which is his balance for the road construction contract he executed for the Nigerian government. 
 But late Mr. Murphy has no next of kin; he died together with his only child Kimberly who is the next of kin. 
 I lived with him for 20 good years and he lost his parents when he was a small boy. Mr. Murphy generation is finished. But nobody knows his history apart from me the personal assistant he told me everything about his life before he died. So this is what I want the both of us to do immediately
 I will present you as the next of kin I have all documents and files of the late Mr. Murphy which will cover you up fully as the next of kin. 
 The Contract Award Committee is waiting for me to inform the next of kin of late Mr. Murphy for him or her to contact the payment committee for them to release the $15 million United States dollars to the next of kin. 
 Anybody I present as the next of kin the money will be given to the person joyfully with my approval. It is only I the personal assistant that can produce the next of kin. This is a quick and sweet business if only you will cooperate with me there is nothing to fear in this business since I am involved. 
 The last letter the contract Award committee wrote to me yesterday was that if I cannot inform the next of kin
 to contact them for the collection of the $15 million
 that the funds will be sent into their government account and it will be used to purchase arms for their soldiers. 
 I am just coming back from their office before writing you this letter; I told them that the next of kin will contact them very soon for the collection of fund. 
 So I want the both of us to do this business together and collect the $15 million dollars when the fund is collected we must remove 10% of the total amount and give to charity homes then yourself and myself will now share the remaining equally 45% for you 45% for me. 
 Please do not tell anybody what I just wrote to you for security reasons and for the safety of the business. 
 Please if you will do this business with me send me your telephone number so that I can reach you. 
 I wait to hear from you as soon as possible.

 Please i wish to solicit your help. My name is Mr.Onwa Williams. I am the son of Late General Alexandre Aka Williams the former Director of military inteligence and special acting General Manager of the Sieria Leone Diamond mining coperation (S.L.D.M.C.) I am writing to seek your good assistance to transfer and invest this sum of $9.000
000.dollars in your country belongs to my late father which he inherited during his life time in my country. 
 This money is revenues from solid minirals and Dimonds sale which were under my fathers possession before the civil war broke out. Following the brake out of the war
 almost all Government offices
coperations and parastatals were attacked and vandalized.The (S.L.D.M.C) was loothed and burnt down to ashes
 and diamonds worth millions of dollars was stolen by the rebel military forces who attacked my fathers office. 
 Many top Government officials and senior Army officers were assasinated and my father was a key target because of his very sensitive military possition and appointment in the (S.L.D.M.C.) regreatable to me
 my father was captured and murdered along with my senior brother in cool blood during a mid-night attack and the rebel when our residence in freetown was armbushed by Fordey Sanko the notorious rebel leader. Our mother sustainded very several bullet injuries which resulted to her untimely and painful death in a private hospital here in Ivory Coast. 
 Now we are alone in a totally strange country without parents
 relatives or any body to care for us at our tender ages. before our mother died
 she told me that my father deposited a hung amount which he made from diamond sales and contracts at this bank here in Ivory Coast and that we should pray and find a trustworthy foreign business partner who would help us to transfer and invest this money in profitable business venture overseas. Mother also advice me to act quickly so that we can leave Ivory Coast with our cousin brother-Arthur who is here in the camp withe us
and then settle down abroad for the rest of our life.She also gave me all the deposit documents to claim the money and then told me that my father used my name as the only son to deposit the money in the bank
and also advice me that this is the reason why we came to Ivory Coast. 
 My mother died after her advice to me May her spirit rest In perfect peace. Furthermore
 I have gone to the bank to make inquires about this deposit and I spoke with the director of International remittance who assured me that verything is intact and promised to help me transfer this money to my foreign partners bank account as soon as I provide the bank account informations. 
 However
 the director is very concerned because of our sitaution here
 I am 17 years and as such promised to help me and he would like to speak with my partner to ensure that this money is invested wisely in only profitable business because of his personal interest and sympathy for my family. Please note that I will offer you 15% of the total money as compensation for your noble assistance in accordiance with my mothers advise.
 "I am interested in any profitable commercial venture which you consider very good in your country and you would also get a school for me and my little sister and my cousin so that we can finish our education. I am hoping to hear from you so that i will give you more details information. Upon the confirmation of this money into your account we will fly immediately to your country to meet with you for onward investment according to my mothers advice."

Telephone number: 0031630655043
 I wish to begin by way of introduction. I am William Mabaye the first and only surviving son of late Tutu Mabaye one of the foremost and rich black farmers in Zimbabwe recently murdered in the land dispute in my country. Before the death of my father
 he had taken me to Johannesburg-South Africa
 to deposit the sum of US$25 million (Tweenty Five Million United States Dollars) in one of the private security companies
 as family valuables
 when he realized the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals for the farms and also for the establishment of new farms in Swaziland.
 This land dispute started when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land reform
 which was particularly targeted at the rich white farmers and a few black farmers (my father included). This resulted in the gruesome killing of rich farmers (mainly whites) and the unlawful possession of their properties by Mugabe?s war veterans
 under the disguise of fighting for the interest of the country.
  It is against this background that I fled the country with my family
 to the Netherlands where we are currently seeking asylum.
 I have decided to seek foreign assistance
 as the Netherlands law prohibits asylum seekers from operating bank accounts or involve in financial transaction of any kind
 hence this letter to you. All I need is your trustworthiness to be able to entrust the above said amount and help me with investment opportunities. My family?s survival depends on this money as we have virtually lost all our assets.
 There are two options
 firstly
 you can choose to accept 25% of the total amount for your assistance or go into partnership for the proper investment of the money in your country. We shall discuss in detail the modalities involved when you reply providing me with your telephone &amp; fax numbers. 
 I await your reply through the  above email 
while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required to ensure a safe and hitch free transaction.I shall furnish you with more details on request.
 Yours truly

FROM: MR JONATHAN BONGANI 
 Good day
 " You may be surprise to receive this letter from mesince you dont know me personally. I am Mr.Jonathan Bongani the son of Dr. Simon Bongani
who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I got your contact through the South Africa Informations Exchange (S.A.I.E) in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction which involves a transfer of fund to a foreign account and I decided to write you
 my late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agents of the ruling government of president Robert Mugabe for his alleged support and sympathy for the Zimbabwean opposition party controlled by the white minority. "
   Before his death he had taken to Johannesburg -South Africa to deposit the sum of US$ 35.5 Million (Thirty-five Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with a Security and Finance Company as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was depositedin a box as valuables to avoid much demurrage from the Security Company. This money was embarked from the purchase of new machinery and chemical for farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland. 
 This land problem arose when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land act that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the "modus operandi" adopted by the government.This resulted to rampant killing and mob action by the war veterans and some political thugs. 
 " precisely
 More than thirty-one (31) people have so far been killed.Heads of governments from the west
 especially Britain and United States of America have voiced their condemnation of Mugabes plan. Subsequently
 South African Development Community(S.A.D.C) has continously supported Mugabes new land act
 it is against this background that I and my family who are currently residing in South Africa have decided to transfer my Fathers money into a foreign account. "
   As the eldest son of my Father
 I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are tactically freezing our family wealth and South Africa\s government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of investing this money in South Africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have almost the same political history.More so
 the South African Foreign Exchange policy does not allow such investment hence we are seeking for an "ASYLUM". 
   As a business person whom I entrusted my future and that of my family into his hands
 I must let you know that this transaction is 100% risk free and the nature of your business does not necessarily matter.For your assistance
we are offering you 30% of the total sum
60% for me and my family while 10% will be mapped out for any expenses we may incure during the course of this transaction.We wish to invest ourpart of the money on commercial property based on your advice. 
 "Finally
all we demand from you is assurance that you will not sit on this money when it finally gets to your personal or companys account in your country. "
  If this proposal is acceptable by you
 please confirm your interest via the above TELEPHONE number +27-83-424-7661or E-MAIL to the above address.

 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 SEEKING FOR FINANCIAL INVESTMENT INFORMATION 
 Zimbabwe formerly Rhodesia under the colonial rule gained independence in 1981 under the nationalist struggle for independence led by Mr. Robert Mugabe and late Joshua Nkomo. Under the white rule and since independence the minority whites that owned most of the farmlands in Zimbabwe have dominated agriculture. The aborigines believe that they are still slaves in their own land if they continue to work the lands for their whites masters even after independence. Robert Mugabe as the black Moses who led his people to freedom has vowed to revoke ownership of the white owned farms and redistribute the lands to the landless blacks. This move he said is necessary to redress the imbalance of the colonial era. For the struggle for freedom
 to affect this initiative the government has amended its land acquisition laws and policies last few months
 which gave about 3000 white Zimba!
  bwean
 My family and I are caught up in this web of land politics
 which also led to the death of our father. We have seen reforms after reforms by the government of Mugabe and we are fed up with it. Our economy is in shambles and it is just not profitable and safe enough for us to remain in Zimbabwe. We have decided to relocate our farm to Swaziland
 a neighbouring country
 where we have acquired lands. Our capital base is in South Africa where we are temporarily living pending such time logistics would be ready for full-scale operation in Swaziland. Bearing in mind that Mr. Thabo Mbeki (South African president) and his government are playing Russian roulette over the Zimbabwean land crisis
 every effort has begun in earnest to move our capital base to a stable country where it can be safer. 
 With a capital base of US$25.5Million
 there is a great deal of secrecy involved to avoid the piercing eyes and smelling noses of both the governments of Zimbabwe and South !
  We are therefore contacting you so you can use a magnificent business technique to transfer this financial treasure out of South Africa. This money is presently deposited confidentially with A security Company here in South Africa. We mapped out 25% of the gross sum as due commission for your expected honest assistance in executing the successful transfer of this money out of South Africa
 for our family investments.
 Please
 email us immediately if you are interested
 so we can discuss further while we hold this correspondence in the strictest confidence.

You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you don’t know me personally
 I am DR RANI ALI JUMA
 the first son of DR. OMAR ALI JUMA
 and he was the VICE PRESIDENT of the REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA. Before he died
 my father died at the age of 63 in the year 2001 after addressing fellow TANZANIANS during the visit of PRESIDENT JOSEPH KABILA of DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO and YUERI MUSEVENI of UGANDA. I got your contact through the Ghana information Exchange (G.I.E) in my search for a reliable and reputable person  to handle a very confidential transaction which involves the transfer of fund to a foreign account and I decided to write you.
 My late father was among the ruling party (CCM) which the opposition party was dominated by his Muslim brothers led by PROF. IBRAHIM LIPUMBA. Before his death he had taken to Europe  to deposit the sum of US$40 million (FORTY MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) with a security and finance company as if he foresaw the looming danger coming. The money was deposited in two sealed boxes as valuables goods to avoid much demurrage from the security company. I most say that the death of my father has warned me and my whole family not to go back to politics. For the fact that PRESIDENT BENJAMIN MKAPA
 never showed any concern since the death of my father and after I discovered that my life was no longer safe I decided to leave to Ghana 
West Africa where I am residing now with my own family.
 Meanwhile here in Ghana West Africa I don’t think of going back and for this I and my family have decided to transfer my father’s money into a foreign account in a Islamic counrty. As the eldest son of my father
 I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who have tactically frozen our family wealth as I may not trust the system of African government. Furthermore
 the new Ghana government does not allow such investment hence I am seeking for asylum. As a business person whom I must entrust my future and that of my family into his hands I must let you know that this transaction is 100% RISK FREE and the nature of your business does not necessarily matter.
 Therefore
 if you accept to assist me and my family
 we are willing to offer you 20% of the total sum for your assistance
 75% for me and my family
 while 5% will be mapped out for any expenses that may be incurred in the process of this transaction. We wish to invest our money on commercial property based on your advice and I will also wish to receive your genuine assurance that you would not sit on this money when it is finally transferred into your personal or company’s account. If this transaction is acceptable by you.
 BEST REGARDS

 never showed any concern since the death of my father and after I discovered that my life was no longer safe I decided to leave to Ghana 
West Africa where I am residing now with my own family.
 Meanwhile here in Ghana West Africa I don’t think of going back and for this I and my family have decided to transfer my father’s money into a foreign account in a Islamic counrty. As the eldest son of my father
 I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who have tactically frozen our family wealth as I may not trust the system of African government. Furthermore
 the new Ghana government does not allow such investment hence I am seeking for asylum. As a business person whom I must entrust my future and that of my family into his hands I must let you know that this transaction is 100% RISK FREE and the nature of your business does not necessarily matter.
 Therefore
 if you accept to assist me and my family
 we are willing to offer you 20% of the total sum for your assistance
 75% for me and my family
 while 5% will be mapped out for any expenses that may be incurred in the process of this transaction. We wish to invest our money on commercial property based on your advice and I will also wish to receive your genuine assurance that you would not sit on this money when it is finally transferred into your personal or company’s account. If this transaction is acceptable by you.
 BEST REGARDS

My proposal to you will be very surprising
 as we have not had any Personal contact before. However
 I sincerely seek your confidence in this transaction
which I propose to you as a person of transparency
honesty and high caliber. 
 Let me first start by introducing myself properly to you. My name is Ron Sinclear
 i was the Personal Assistance to the    (Haitian) President . I apologize if I have infringed on your privacy. It may interest you to know that the former president of (Haiti) has been fighting serious  war for United  Democracy  for quite some years now
 which has been backed (all along) by some foreign powerful countries.
 Not quite long ago
 the American government ordered  (President
 Jean Bertrand Aristed) to leave  (Haiti) or be forced out of power by a Rabel force.Knowing fully well the capabilities of America and other powerful members of the United Nations
 (President Aristed) decided
and left the seat of power  into exile in South Africa country to seek asylum. now a new government is in place .
 In the light of all these sad happenings
 there was this deposit he made with a Security Company in Europe in year May 2001 
this took place while he was still in power as the president of Haiti
 through my aid
 his Personal Assistant
 (Ron Sinclear) and some loyalist
 he suceeded to secretely move the sum of ($9.5M USD) (NINE MILLION
FIVE HUNDERED THOUSAND
 UNITED STATES DOLLARS] to a private security company vault in Europe. Now
 we need your services as  a highly reliable foreigner to receive the funds into your bank account for the future survival of my family because he (Aristed)  cannot presently operate any foreign bank account in his name. These funds (US$9.5m USD.) arose from various money i received from the sales of diamonds deals
 i had with ( President Charles Taylor) of Liberia
 which are abound in great quantity around the coastal areas of  liberia.  
 I have decided that if you are able assist us
you shall be compensated with 25% commission of the funds
 5% of this money shall be set aside to take care of any local or foreign expenses that might be incurred along the line. My family will have the remaining 75% of the funds. It might also interest you to note that all security arrangements regarding this  transaction has been put in place
 therefore
you have nothing whatsoever to fear or worry about
 as every arrangement will be co-handled by you and my former Personal Assistant (Ron Sinclear) who is now presentely in Europe The Netherlands for possible conclusion of this arrangement.
 Most part of this share (70%) for my family will also be invested in a lucrative business courtesy of your full advice
 assistance and connections because that is the most importat part of this transaction. As you indicate interest to assist my family
please kindly send to us your telephone/fax numbers for further discussion and clarification.I will be expecting to receive your urgent response for us to proceed to more details on .this pending transaction.

 and rosy relationship between my family and yours
 Yours Faithfully


It is with heartfelt hope that I write to seek your co-operation and assistance in the context stated below:May I first introduce my self: I am DR.(MRS.) MARIAM ABACHA
the wife of Late General Sani Abacha (former Military head of state and President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria) who died suddenly on 8th June
 1998. I got your contact through the help of my sister-inlaw that works with the Canadian Chambers of Commerce and Tourrism
though
I did not disclose to her my humble intention for a honest foreigner who will help save my life and my children. Having noted the confidence reposed on your person by the sponsor of the recommendation
 I became convinced of your capability and goodwill to assist me in receiving the sum of US$20 Million secretly willed in my favour by the late general (my husband).
    This money was kept in a Security Company in Spain and I have 
 all documents with me as of when it was deposited in a Security Vault for safe keeping.This money has been defaced for Security reasons and also to avoid it been spent by unauthorized persons.We have been deliberating on how to invest this fund abroad in a confidential manner until we came to a conclusion to use it to buy houses and part of it will be used for non-speculative investments in your country.However
the current civilian administration of retired General Olusegun Obasanjo(The President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria) is seeking vengeance on the Abacha family because of the life prison jail sentence confirmed on him by my late husband while in office. In pursuit of this vendetta
the present Government have resolved to freeze all known assets of General Sani Abacha including properties at home and abroad and are presently embarking on to seize the various bank accounts of my husband in Switzerland
UK and Australia. In fact
 the attack on ou!
 " r family (The Abachas) is so devastated to an extent of seizing our travelling passport
family accounts and even trying some members of our family in court for offences allegedly committed by my late husband. My first son Mohammed Abacha who was arrested and incacerated for the past 3years was just reliese from prison on the agreement to refund $1.5 Billion to the Federal Government of Nigeria allegedly stollen by my late Husband.We are not ready to comply to this as most of the family assets and bank accounts abroad have been Freezen by the Obasanjo regime."
   In view of this grevious threat to our Economic and personal survival
our family trustee have secretly protected the will
The Security Company has called me to do something about claiming this consignment because of the demurrage it is incurring and I told them we would come and claim it very soon but they seriously advised me to move the fund into an overseas account
 hence the reason why I have chosen you and hope that you will come to my full assistance and unlimited co-operation.In the meantime
there is a travelling embargo on us(the whole family members) and our local accounts are seized. We are currently living on goodwill of people who believe we cannot be held responsible for the sins of my late husband. In view of this plight
 I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this distressed call to save me and my children from a hopeless future. And if you agree to help
 we will compensate you sincerely for your candid effort in!
 "  this regard with 25% of the total amount of $20 Million US Dollars.In that case
 when the money ($20 Million) is moved into your discrete account
 you will be allowed to withdraw 25% in your favour
while 10% has been set aside for any expenses you might incure (There are demurrage to pay before the fund is sign and claimed by you.)during the process of securing this fund.The remaining 65% will be invested meaningfully for my childrens future. "
   My cousin (KADIRI MOHAMMED) has perfected arrangements with the Trust Company concerned and has been assured 100% risk free and safe operation.What I demand from you now is to arrange to visit the Finance Company where this money is being deposited and claim it as the bona-fide owner.
 And in due course
 all contacts must be made through
 DR.KADIRI MOHAMMED through his Telephone: 00 221 5124859.
 E-mail address: kadiri_hammed@elvis.com
 I look forward to your quick response while thanking
 you for your co-operation. In view of all above
 details
 I request you to keep this letter and
 co-operation highly confidential.
 Best wishes

SOUTH AFRICA 
 Let me start by introducing myself. I am MR JAMES TSHABALALA a bank manager with a commercial bank here in South Africa. I came to know about you in my private search for a reliable person/company to handle a confidential Portfolio that is under my supervision. During my visit to Pretoria
 one of my associates there
 in confidence gave me your contact address. With srong hope that you are my search
 I decided to put before you this proposal. 
 The Portfolio: 
 A German man called Mr. Wolfgang Schiniter
 66 years of age and a prosperous farmer had deposited with us a sum of TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS(U.S.$20Million). His wife Mrs. Helga Schiniter is the legitimate beneficiary to this account. Unfortunately they were both killed in the air crash involving Concord AF4590 in Gonesse
 France. 
 Our serch through the german embassy to find any of the next of kin
 have all proved fruitless. 
 According to the embassy
 the couple had no offspring. The Firm is still unrelenting in its effort to contact any of the relatives for possible claim of this money
 or the fund will be transfared to the government cofferes. In order to avoid this development
 my colleagues and I now seek your permission to have you stand as a distant relative to Mr. Wolfgang Schiniter so that the funds would be released to you. 
 All the documents and proofs of identity to further enable you get these funds will be worked out. 
 We "the Firm"
 have secured the order of mandamus fom the court to serch and locate any of the deceased relatives. This is why I am asking you to present yourself as the possible closest next of kin.
 I have also decided that you will generously be entitled to 30% of the total amount
 I has also map out 10% for any expenses that might come during the process of the transaction
 why 60% will be for me.  Upon my receipt of your reply confirming your willingness to assist me If your good self accsept to this request
 I will then commence with the procuement of the necessary documents to back your claim as the next of kin. 
 Thanks
 we wait to hear from you. 
 Yours sincerely

Good day. My name is Momoni Adoh . I am the regional manager of International Commercial Bank Takoradi branch eastern region of the Republic of Ghana (West Africa). I write you this letter in good faith. I got your contact address from a recent banking forum held in Lome the capital city of Togo our next door neighbor
 hence I write you to ask for your assistance in a business venture that will benefit you and I.
 On January of 2000
 one Mr. Dennis Burles who has been living and working in a gold company called Obuasi Goldfields died in the Kenya airways fatal air crash on the coast of Cote D Ivorie on its way to Accra  the capital city of Ghana.
 I was the personal banker to the late Mr. Burles
 before his untimely death. You see my friend
 the late Mr. Burles had $3M USD deposited in a fixed deposit account in my branch
 without any next of kin to inherit the sum
 that is the reason I write you this letter. I need you to stand claim as the next of kin so that my bank will not declare this funds a deceased account non-grata
 meaning that the bank has full and legal right to claim the funds
 since the policy of the bank on deceased customer account is that after 5 years if there is no claim
 the funds will be immediately taken by the bank.
 Frankly speaking I have been working in this bank for close to 10 years and I have nothing to show for it
 my yearly income is barely about $2
500 USD after tax and the major reason I packaged this transaction is that I have a 9 year old daughter with leukemia and needs a bone marrow transplant or she will die. I have already made arrangement for this surgery in the UK but I could not afford it
 so I really need your help to do this deal or my daughter will die. I am offering you 25% of the total sum after this money is wired to your account
 because it is a simple bank-to-bank inheritance claim payment transfer. I will also like you to get me rest assured that you will not abandon me when the money gets to your account. You can reach me on tell: +233 244231712
 I have all the payment claim information worked out. Bye for now and thanks for your understanding.

HANG SENG BANK LTD.
 DES VOEUX RD. BRANCH

 CENTRAL HONG KONG

 HONK KONG.
 Dear Sir

  Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Wang Qin credit officer of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd.  I have a concealed business suggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client General. Ibrahim Moussa who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months
 with a value of Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch.  Upon maturity several notice was sent to him
 even during the war early this year. Again after the war  another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the General and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen. Ibrahim Moussa did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. 
  So
 Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration 3 years and 10 months the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.Against this backdrop
 my suggestion to you is thatI will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa so that you will be able to receive his funds.
 WHAT IS TO BE DONE:
  I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa
 all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin
 the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you. There is no risk involved at all in the matter as weare going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue.
  Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me
 25% for you and 5% for any expenses incurred during the course of this operation. Should you be interested please send me your private phone and fax numbers for easy communication and I will provide you with more details of this operation.
  Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.
 Kind Regards

 Mr. Wang  Qin
 Greetings from ClanAFO:: Desert Combat

"As you read this
 I dont want you to feel sorry for me because I believe everyone will die someday. My name is Dasuki Al-Mehmood
 a merchant in Dubai U.A.E."
 I have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment
 and right now I have only about a few months to live
 according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well
 as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business.
 Though I am very rich
 I was never generous
 I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.
 I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me
 I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends.
 I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so
 I have decided to give alms to charity organizations
 as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth.
 Now that my health has deteriorated so badly
 I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan; they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence
 I do not trust them anymore
 as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them.
 The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of $6M. (Six Million United States Dollars) that I have with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations. I have set aside 10 % for you and God be with you. Please All correspondence should be directed to Dasuk-al-mehmo@excite.com

 "I am contacting you in the belief that you are a honest and trustworthy person.I hope you will not betray the confidence I have in you to have contacted you even though weve not met before.Besides
I only got your address from an internet listing.I am Dr.Donald Ike
Head of Banking Operations
Eastern Banking Unit of one of the biggest banks in Africa.I will not mention the name of the bank I work for security reasons but promise to disclose it to you as soon as I am convinced that you are capable and willing to assist me with this transaction.I hope this does not turn you off anyway;I am only being cautious."
 The account numbers mentioned above belong to late Engr.Philip De Wulf
a Belgian who was the managing director of Energy Services International ESI
a petrol and oil servicing company .This company has been a household name in the downstream s-ector of my country for its professional
 service provision especially in the late 80s but after the death of Engr.Wulf everything began to take a rather retrogressive trend largely due to the inefficiency of his successor.
 I personally manage the accounts of this company as well as the personal account of Engr.P.D.Wulf
 .Shortly before his death in a ghastly motor accident which claimed his life and that of his newly married wife Mrs.Debra Wulf in 1993
I had received some receivables in the form of cheque payment on behalf of my esteemed customer
Engr.Wulf and since he instructed that all personal
 cheques be paid to his online account
I followed the instruction to the latter.However as a result of his death
this account remained unserviced for a long time neither was there any person named next of kin .
 The net balance of this account till date is One Hundred and Forty Eight Million
Nine Hundred and Forty Eight Thousand
Five Hundred United States Dollars($148
948
500.00).According to the Banking and Other Financial Act 1991 (as amended) of my country if such deposit is not claimed twelve years after the demise of the account holder
the Board of Directors should recommend to the Federal Authorites that efforts were actually made to establish the next - of -kin but due to non was specified by the deceased
that the Federal Government should inherit the account.The
 actual fact on ground is that the directors do not return such money to the Fedeal
 Authorities
instead they share and stach it in their foreign accounts amongst themselves.This should go far to explain why the bank is not making any effort in trying to locate any relation of this man for about a decade now but individual investigation conducted by myself shows that there is no information about his relations mentioned in any of the account opening documents filed at the bank.
 All I want you to do is to collaborate with me by standing in as the beneficiary because Management is ready to approve the remittance of the money to any foreigner who has correct information of this account.Beside I would use my position to facilitate prompt remittance of the
 "fund.Send to me immediately the your business porofile as well as your bank account information of any bank of your choice where you want the money to be transfered.You may open a new account if you so wish.If for any reason you think youre incapable of this transaction

I will consult a probate lawyer on your behalf as the beneficiary for the drafting and notarization of the will and to obtain the neccesary documents and letter of Probate/Administration in your favour so as to put you in better position as the beneficiary .Please you have to be eraborate in your profile to enable
 me make a good assessment about your desirability.I shall tell you the name of my bank soon after I am convinced of your personality.
 I also need strong assurances from you to the effect that you can guarantee the safety of the money when it gets to your account.However
I want you to understand that as a man of strong character it beats my conscience that I have to do this deal for two strong reasons.Firstly 
to
 curtail the excesses of the directors and secondly to plan ahead of my retirement which is just few months from now.In view of this
you may be approached after the transfer to provide me with investment advice as I plan to invest the fund in any lucrative venture after retirement.
 At the conclusion of this business
 I shall travel to your country for sharing.I have mapped out 30% of the total amount for you for assisting me
5% to take care of all expenses from both party and the remaining for me.
 I await information about you and look forward for prompt reply from you.

 HONG KONG.
 Dear Sir

  Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Wang Qin credit officer of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd.  I have a concealed business suggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client General. Ibrahim Moussa who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months
 with a value of Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch.  Upon maturity several notice was sent to him
 even during the war early this year. Again after the war  another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the General and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen. Ibrahim Moussa did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. S!
  o
 Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. 
  Against this backdrop
 my suggestion to you is thatI will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa so that you will be able to receive his funds.
 WHAT IS TO BE DONE:
 I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa
 all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin
 the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you. There is no risk involved at all in the matter as weare going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue.
  Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me
 25% for you and 5% for any expenses incurred during the course of this operation. Should you be interested please send me your private phone and fax numbers for easy communication and I will provide you with more details of this operation.
  Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL
 RE: TRANSFER OF US$21.5 MILLION (TWENTY ONE MILLION
 FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLARS ONLY).
 I know this email will reach you as a surprise
 but need not to worry as we are using the only secured and confidential medium available to seek for foreign assistance/partnership in a business transaction
 which is of mutual benefit.
 I am a member of the Federal Government of Nigeria Contract Award and Monitoring Committee in the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). Sometime ago
 a contract was awarded to a foreign firm in NNPC by my Committee. This contract was over invoiced to the tune of US$21.5M. U.S. dollars. This was done deliberately. The over-invoicing was a deal by my committee to benefit from the project. We now want to transfer this money which is in a suspense Account with NNPC into any Overseas Account which we expect you to provide for us.
 For providing the account where we shall remit the money into
 you will be entitled to 30% of the money
 60% will be for me and my partners while 10% has been mapped out from the total sum to cover any expenses that maybe incurred by us during the course of this transfer
 both locally and international expenses.
 I would require the following: -
 "1. Your companys names
 address telephones and fax numbers."
 2. The bank where the money will be remitted to.
 The above information would be used to make formal applications as a matter of procedure for the release of the money and onward transfer to your account. It does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of this nature described here. The assumption is that your company won the major contract and subcontracted it out to other companies. More often than not
 big trading companies or firms of unrelated fields win major contracts and subcontracts to more specialized firms for execution of such contracts.
 We have strong reliable connections and contacts at the Central Bank of Nigeria
 as well as the Federal Ministry of Finance and we have no doubt that all the money will be released and transferred if we get the necessary foreign partner to assist us in this deal. Therefore
 when the business is successfully concluded we shall through our same connections withdraw all documents used from all the concerned Government Ministries for 100% security.
 We are ordinary civil servants and we will not want to miss this once in a lifetime opportunity to get rich. We want this money to be transferred to the overseas Accounts for us
 before the present Democratic Government starts auditing all Federal Government owned Parstatals.
 Please contact me immediately through my private mailbox (tobi4120a@k.ro). If you are not
 it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal. But where you are interested
 send the required documents aforementioned herein through my above mailbox
 as time is of the essence in this business.
 I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.
 Yours faithfully

 Mr.James Tobi

Dear Sir/Madam

  My name is Dr. Jomo Vayani a director with Transparency international 
Kenya. I got your email address from the web directory so I decided to contact you. We are interested in diverting some funds currently floating in the suspense account of the federal pay office to your account as soon as possible. 
 "Source of the funds: During the Arap Mois government
 governments officials awarded contracts to their own companies
 these contracts were grossly overinvoiced. Now the present government set up contract review panel to settle those owed outstanding amount. My colleagues and I have identified a huge amount totaling US$ 870m (Eight hundred and seventy million us dollars) oversea . "
 "We would wantUS$43.8m (Forty three million Eight Hundred Thousand) dollars out of this money overseas transferred to your account because we are not eligible to operate foreign accounts
 and I have been mandated to search for a partner abroad. We really want this transfer made as soon as possible before the Government
 who have started refunding money from Mois foreign accounts track this money.We will be offering 20% for your assistance."
  If you would want to proceed with this transaction please reply with your name and phone number to jvayani@karibu.kenyaweb.com and if you do not accept my offer please treat with utmost confidentiality.
 Best Regards

 Dr. Jomo Vayani.

My other was able to  smuggle the documents out of the cellar.

 RE: PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USE IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD.
 I am the above named person from Kuwait. I am married to Dr. Harry Jones who worked with Kuwait embassy in Ivory Coast for nine years
 before he died in the year 2000.We were both married for eleven years without a child.
 He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians. Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is all against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $18.6Million (Eighteen Million six hundred thousand U.S.Dollars) with a finance/security company in Europe. Presently
 this money is still with the Security Company in Europe for safe keeping. Recently
 my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three months due to my cancer problem.
 "Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition of health I have decided to donate this fund to churches
 orphanage or a better Christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want an individual that will use these fund to fund churches
 orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to nderstand that blessed is the hand that giveth.I took this decision because I dont have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I dont want my husbands hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. As I do not want a situation whereby this money will be used in an ungodly manner."
 "Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I dont need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health and also due of the presence of my husbands relatives around me always. I dont want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Finance/ Security Company in Europe. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the original- beneficiary of this said fund. I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my "
 shepherd.
 My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a church or Christian individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated here in.
 Hoping to hearing from you.
 "PLEASE I WILL ADVICE YOU TO GIVE MY LAWYER IN CHARGE A CALL IMMEDIATELY

 I know this email will reach you as a surprise
 but need not to worry as i am  using the only secured  and confidential medium available to seekfor foreign assistance in a business.I am Mr JOHN DUF from the AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK.(ADB)
 DAKAR-SENEGAL.Branch. 
  This business request may seem strange
 but I crave your indulgence and pray you view it seriously as I am convinced that you would be capable to provide me with a solution to a money transfer.On June 6
 1999
 an America Oil consultant/contractor with  Petroleum Corporation
 Mrs. Barbara .A. Bill made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months
 valued at US$10
500
000.00(TEN Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars )in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month
 we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers
 the  Petroleum Corporation that Mrs. Barbara .A. Bill and har husband and their only son. died in the plane crash On October 31
 1999
 (an Egyptair Boeing 767 Flight 990) with other passengers on board as you can confirm it yourself via the website below:http://www.marsearthconnection.com/ea990.html
 "On further investigation
 I found out that she died without making a  WILL and attempts to trace har next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mrs. Barbara .A. Bill did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents
including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$10
500
000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it According to AFRICAN law
 at the expiration of (five) years
 the money will revert to the ownership of the SENEGAL Government if nobody  applies to claim the fund.Consequently
 my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to  stand as the next of kin to Mrs. Barbara .A. Bill so that the fruit of this old womans labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt Government officials. This is simple
 I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin.We shall employ the service of two attorneys for the drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter  of probate administration in your favour for the transfer. Any bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you and 10 % will  be set aside for expenses incured during the business . There is no risk at all; the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested
 please reply immediately via the private email address below
 upon your responses
 I shall provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this  transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.Please upon the receipt of this mail message

560
000.00 USD (Thirty Six Million Five Hundred and Sixty Thousand U.S. Dollars Only). This sum arose from a deliberate over-invoicing of contract bills of some contracts
 which were awarded by us (MPNR) during the administration of the former military dictator late
 General Sanni Abacha who died on 7th June 1998. Since then the money has been lying in our suspense current account of MPNR with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)(our Apex Bank). However

 the nature of your business is not particularly relevant for the success of this transaction. All we require is your willingness to co-operate with us
 and also an assurance that our Share of the funds will be given to us when the money arrives your account.
 Most importantly
 we have taken all necessary precautions to ensure a no risk situation on the side of both parties as this transaction is expected to be through within 10 to 14 working days. Please if the proposal is acceptable to you

Dear friend
\xa0
 I wish to begin by way of introduction. I am Kenneth Masuku
 the first and only surviving son of late Marc Masuku one of the foremost and rich black farmers in Zimbabwe recently murdered in the land dispute in my country. Before the death of my father
 he had given me the certificate of deposite he used to deposit the sum of US$30.5 million (Thirty Million Five Hundred United State Dollars) in one of the private security companies in Europe
 as family valuables
 when he realized the looming dangers in Zimbabwe.\xa0
 This amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals\xa0
 for the farms and also for the establishment of new farms in Swaziland.This land dispute started when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land reform
 which was particularly targeted at the rich white farmers and a few black farmers (my father included).\xa0
 This resulted in the gruesome killing of rich farmers (mainly whites) and\xa0
 "the unlawful possession of their properties by Mugabes war veterans
 under the disguise of fighting for the interest of the country. It is against this background that I fled the country with my family
 to the Netherlands where we are currently seeking asylum.\xa0"
 "I have decided to seek foreign assistance
 as the Netherlands law prohibits asylum seekers from operating bank accounts or involve in financial transaction of any kind
 hence this letter to you. All I need is your trustworthiness to be able to entrust the above said amount and help me with investment opportunities. My familys survival depends on this money as we have virtually lost all our assets.\xa0"
 There are two options
 firstly
 you can choose to accept 15% of the total\xa0
 amount for your assistance or go into partnership for the proper investment of the money in your country.\xa0
 We shall discuss in detail the modalities involved when I hear from you.\xa0
 I await your reply through the above media
 while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required to ensure a safe and hitch free transaction.\xa0
 I shall furnish you with more details on request.\xa0
 Yours truly

 Mrs Elizabeth Ogali

I am Mr Ahmed Ali
a member of the Movement For Democratic Change in Zimbabwe... my party is opposed to the Zanu-PF party of the incumbent President Robert Mugabe.I went into a partnership with a white farmer and a buisness man in Zimbabwe and as we progressed in buisness
i bought his ideas and philosophy which made me join the movement for democratic change which is dominated by the whites(of which my colleague is a top member).
 We control a greater portion of the white-dominated farms in Zimbabwe and we are major shareholders in major companies in Zimbabwe.The Mugabe government and his political associates are not tolerant with the activities of the movement for demcratic change and he is using indirect guerilla war tactic to oppress the members.
 Zimbabwe war veterans invaded our farm and confiscated some of our assets and held us hostage.I managed to escape from their brutality but my buisness partner died on the struggle.He left message that i should sell off all our assets including the farms
estates and the companies ensuring that his family relocates oversea and also to invest the money propperly bearing in mined that the next step of the guerillas will be to confiscate those remaining assets.
 "I have successfully sold off the remaining portion of our estate 
 companies and farms after which i managed with the help of the immigration to sneak out of zimbabwe with my friends family to Dubai
so right now we are in Dubai(UAE).The total sum in our possession at this moment is US$14M(fourteen million) realised from the aution sales of the estate 
farms and companies.The money is secured in a security company."
 "I got to know you from your countrys buisness journal in johannesburg world trade center(WTC)and from my careful analysis i realized that you could assist in this venture.All i want u to do is to make urgent arrangement and come down to Dubai so that you could open a non-resident account which will use in transfering the money into your nominated account overseas for onward investment."
 "I have two options for you
the first is that you could choose to have a certain agreeable percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction
the other is you could as well go into a joint business partnership with me for proper investment of the fund in your country. Which ever way you want it
feel free to notify me.I have also mapped out %5 of the money for all kinds of expenses incured in the process of the transaction and if you dont prefer joint partnership
i am offering you %20 of the fund while the rest %75 will be for my investment."
 Pls contact me immidiately so we can proceed in details.

I know that this proposal might be a surprise to you but do consider it as an emergency. In a nut shell
 My name is Miss Elisabeth Kabba 20 years old from the republic of Sierria-Leone in west Africa
 now seeking for refugee in Dakar -Senegal under the(UNHCR).
 The only child of late Dr David Kabba. I am looking for someone who can take me as child I promise to be obidient to you and I will bring happiness to your life. I got your contact while surfing the net.I want you to assist me in this transaction. My late father was the managing director of Rainbow Gold and Diamond Mine company in (KENEMA)Sierra-Leone. But he was killed along side with my mother during the longing
 civil war and all his properties were totally destroyed.
 However
 after their death I managed to escape with very important files of my father.He has the sum of (US$10.5M)Ten million five hundred thousand U.S Dollars only. This amount was deposited by my late
 father in one of the leading Security company here in senegal. The deposit documents indicate me as the next of kin. Presently
 I am saddled with the problem of securing a trust worthy foriegn personality to help me. I will map out 10% for you.
 (1)Stand on my behalf as the beneficiary for the claim of the inheritance from the Security company since the management of the Security company adviced that I should solicit for an individual or corporate organization to claim the deposit for me as they cannot release it directly to me due to my refugee status in Senegal.
 (2)Transfer the money over to your own country and into your possession pending my arrival to meet with you.
 (3)Invest and manage the money for me in a good business pending my maturity.
 (4) Help me secure my travelling documents to meet you as soon as my money is released to you.
 Furthermore
you can contact the Security company here in senegal for confirmation and I will issue a letter of authorisation on your name
that will enable the Bank correspond with you on my behalf.
 I am giving you this offers as mentioned with every confidence on your acceptance to assist me or adopt me as your Child if possible and manage the money for me.
 "Conclusively
I wish you send me a reply immediately you recieve this proposal. Until then
I remain with the best Stay Blessed.You can also contact me through this email address....elisabethkabba@yahoo.co.uk.in case i dont respond to your mail as earlier."

 Subject: Investment Proposal. Re: Transfer of Fifty Million United States Dollars
 (US$50
000
 000.00)
 I am Hon. Mr. Hope Sithole one of the Personal Assistants to the young President Joseph Kabila of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
 since he assumed power.Sincerely speaking
 my agitation is real
 and my word is my bond in this proposal. This money in question is part of the budget made by our President Mr. Joseph Kabila
 in the fear that members of the United Nations (UN) could perhaps be mandated to offer their respective supports in forcing Iraq to disarm themselves. Eventually
 his dreams do not match up with realities and as a result he (the President) started using the money on personal ground because nobody could question/probe his actions
 as he believed.
 As his closest personal assistant and with the help of two other officials one of whom was the then deputy Director
 Safety and Security Department
 we were able to escape with two boxes containing the aforementioned sum. At present the boxes were deposited in a reputable Security firm here in South Africa and were registered as family belongings. We had agreed on the need for a foreign assistance with a legitimate bank account abroad
 that will stand as
 the beneficiary and partner as well in order to avoid suspicion
 since we are existing as refugees here. Copies of certificate of Deposit as well as all necessary documents from the Security cc. are available for a hitch-free transaction.
 In addition
 you are also required to come/send a representative (as far as you trust the person representing) to the Republic of South Africa for the purpose of the transfer
 but only if
 by one reason or the other you cannot embark on a Five working (5) days trip by yourself
 according to the expert from within the bank. As things are now we had not really agreed on the actual amount that should be your remuneration for your kind assistance
 which to us is no big deal. The crux of this subject in particular is the declaration of your interest after-which we enter into negotiations with you over the (percentage) issue. Other details of which you may want to know shall be discussed in due course.
 Please be kind enough to acknowledge this proposal by responding through the above E-mail address for a high level of confidentiality in this business deal.

 ATTN: CEO/DIRECTOR

 I know the acknowledgment of this letter will sound surprising considering the fact that
 there wasn�t an earlier information regarding this letter. However I discovered your contact through the South Africa trade and industry
 and it was convincing to deal with you based on this information of yours.
 I am Mr. Gibson Fernando
 the only son of Vicent Fernando
 from Bulawayo in Zimbabwe. My father happens to be among the well to do farmers and also the president of Co-operative Agriculture Societies (CAS) in Zimbabwe before he was murdered in cold blood by agents of the ruling junta of President Robert Mugabe for his alleged support for the opposition party
 the (M.D.C). Before my father�s death he disclosed to me some information about a total sum of USD 22
000
000.00 (Twenty Two Million  United States Dollars only) that was to be used for purchase of farming machinery equipment for Zimbabwean cooperative union of which he was the president. Unfortunately
 he could not proceed with the purchase because the land problem aroused again when President Robert Mugabe started his new land act project which woolly affected all the rich farmers in Zimbabwe. As a result of this development
 my wife and I decided to move to South Africa where we are now seeking Political asylum and the clause in my asylum status does not allow me to operate any banking transaction. After the death of my father
 I quickly made arrangement to deface and smuggle the money into South Africa through diplomatic means. To reduce the cost of deposit and risk
 the actual content of the box was not disclosed to the security company but instead the box was deposited as precious items valued at that amount.
  In view of these you will understand that my father�s death was politically motivated and this made me not to wish to invest this money in any African country. My only option is to seek for your assistance and if willing
 you are required to come down to South Africa to open A NON-RESIDENT/ DOLLAR BANK ACCOUNT on your name where this money will be deposited for wire transfer into your nominated account overseas. If you are willing to assist in this regards
 I worked out 25% of the total sum for your assistance rendered
 5% set aside for whatever financial expenses encountered in the process of transferring this money outside South Africa and 70% for myself and family.
  Be rest assured that this business is 100% risk free because I have worked out all modalities for the smooth transfer of this money to your chosen nominated account. I require an absolute secrecy and confidentiality for my security and for the successful transfer of this money (this happen to be a very important condition to offer). I will travel back with you to your country and take my share of 70% or alternatively
 invest my share in your country under your supervision into any profitable business venture.  Kindly contact me with the following data:
 1. Your complete profile. 2. Your specific business/ investment offer
 and other areas of investment you can readily make available  3. Your personal telephone and fax no for confidentiality of this deal.

 Attention:The President/CEO.
 I am barrister David Clovis (Esq.)
 an English speaking Senegalese Solicitor &amp; Financial Attorney/Consultant.I was the personal attorney to late Daniel Thorp who was an expatriate mining consultant/contractor with Teaser Petroleum Corporation in St Louis-Senegal.Mr. Daniel Thorp here-in-after referred as my client was also a Diamond/Gold Merchant.
 Mr.Daniel Thorp made a numbered time (Fixed) deposit for US$12
500
000.00 (Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars Only) in a bank in Dakar
 capital of Senegal with standing statement/agreement with the bank that all correspondences in respect to the fixed deposit contract must be sent to him through my humble chambers. Upon maturity
 the routine notification was sent to me whom I dispatched to his forwarding address as usual without no reply. After a month
 I sent areminder which I received from the bank without any reply again.
 Finally
 I discovered from my client’s contract employers- Teaser Petroleum Corporation that he died among many others in the Kenya Airways flight of 31st January
 2000 that crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in Abidjan
 Cote D’Ivoire. On further investigations
 I found out that he died without making any WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I also discovered that Mr. Daniel Thorp did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents
 including his fixed deposit contract with the bank in Dakar-Senegal.
 I am contacting you based on the official letter I just received from his bankers reminding me that Senegalese law states that at the expiration of 5 (five) years the money will revert to the ownership of the Senegalese Government if I do not confirm the next of kin to claim the fund.
 Consequently
 my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kinto Mr. Daniel Thorp so that the fruits of this old man’s labor will not go into the hands of some corrupt government officials. Note that this transaction is simple and risk free because I will provide expert legal services that will guarantee the successful execution of this deal.
 I wish to point out that after the claims
 I would want 20% of this money to be shared among charity organizations
 while the remaining 80% is shared equally between us. Most importantly
 I would also require your assistance towards investing my share in your country or anywhere as you may advice.
 If you are interested
 please contact me via my email address :davidchambers@katamail.com. Upon your response
 I shall provide you with more details and how we shall proceed with the claims. I expect you to observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be profitable for both of us.

 Dear Friend
          I am Jun Cheng a manager of bills/exchange at the  foreign remittance  department of Hanivitbank. In my department
 we  discovered an  abandoned sum of  $44
700
000.00 (Forty Four Million
 Seven Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only) in an account that  belonged to one Late Mr Andrew Phillips an American
 who died along with his entire  family
 on November  1996
 in a ghastly plane crash. Since we got the  information about his death
  we have been expecting his next-of-kin to come over and file a claim as next of kin over his money because we can not release it unless somebody applied for it as next of  kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our  banking guidelines.
           Unfortunately
 nobody has come forward to claim this  money.  It is based on this that some officials in my department and I have decided to establish a cordial business relationship  with you
 hence by contacting you. We want you to present yourself as the  next of kin  to Late Mr Andrew Phillips
 so that the funds can be remitted into your account. Moreover
 we do not want the money to go into the government account as unclaimed bills. The banking law and guidelines here  stipulates that  any account abandoned or is dormant for a period of years
 is deemed closed and all money contained therein forfeited to the government treasury account.
             Now
 it is being speculated that the above sum will be transferred into the government account as an unclaimed fund on or before the end of this financial quarter of 2004
 when nobody come forward to lay claims. The reason for requesting your assistance
 is occasioned by
 the fact that the deceased (Late Mr Andrew Phillips) was a foreigner
 and we have access to his detailed bio data which you will hold as a weapon to present yourself as the next of kin to Late Mr Andrew Phillips.
           The mode of sharing after a successful transfer of the money into your account
 shall be 70% to my colleagues and I
 for the role you will be expected to play in this deal
 we have agreed to give you 25% of the total sum and 5% for the expenses we are going to encounter by the two parties in the course of this transaction. Therefore
you are expected to reply this letter indicating your readiness and interest to participate in this business. After receiving your reply
 you will be communicated to with the exact steps to take. I expect your urgent response and I shall contact you for further discussion on this matter
to enable us conclude this transaction urgently without any delay or hitch. Please treat this business proposal as strictly confidential for security reasons considering my official position in Bank of Korea.
 Personal Regards

HANG SENG BANK LTD.
 DES VOEUX RD. BRANCH

 CENTRAL HONG KONG

 HONG KONG.
 Dear Sir

    Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Wang Qin credit officer of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd.  I have a concealed business suggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client General. Ibrahim Moussa who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months
 with a value of Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch.  Upon maturity several notice was sent to him
 even during the war early this year. Again after the war  another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the General and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen. Ibrahim Moussa did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office 
 that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank.
  So
 Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration 4years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.Against this backdrop
 my suggestion to you is that I will like youas a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa so that you will be able to receive his funds.
 WHAT IS TO BE DONE:
 I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa
 all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin
 the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you. 
  There is no risk involved at all in the matter as weare going adopt alegalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue.Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bankaccount we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me
 25% for you and 5% for anyexpenses incurred during the course of this operation. Should you be interested please send me your private phone and fax numbers for easy communication and I will provide you with more details of this operation. Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.
 Kind Regards

 Mr. Wang  Qin

 Dearest Valued Friend

 It is with deep sense of honor and respect that I humbly make this appeal to you with the understanding that any fact/s or opinion/s expressed in this letter are given in confidence and solely for your personal information and use. If it does not interest you
 discard the mail but if it makes sense to you
 I open my arms wide to do business with you.
 I take liberty anchored on strong desire to solicit for your assistance on this mutual beneficiary and risk free transaction with you
 which I hope you give urgent attention. To be precise;
 Your information were given to me by a member of the South African Export Promotion Council (SAEPC) who was with the Black Economic Empowerment Commission (Government) delegation on a trip to the United States during abilateral conference talk to encourage foreign investors. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in execution of a deal hereunder for the benefit of all parties
 and hope you will keep it confidential because of the nature of this business. Within the Department of Mining Resources where I work as the Director of Project Implementation
 with co-operation of two other top officials
 we have in our possession
 an overdue payment in US funds. 
 The said funds represent certain percentage of the contract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by a foreign contracting firm
 which we the officials over-invoiced to the amount of US$41
500
000.00 (Forty One Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor
 leaving the excess balance unclaimed. The Government of the Republic of South Africa believe that private investment in general
 and foreign direct investment in particular
 are the real engines for sustainable economic development
 for which reason it has continued to encouraged investment in the key growth-oriented sector of Mining with sincere determination to pay foreign contractors all debts owed to them
 so as to continue to enjoy close relationship
 and mutually beneficial co-operation with foreign governments and non-governmental financial agencies. As a result we included our bills for approvals with the co-operation of some officials at the Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank of South Africa (RBSA). 
 "We are seeking your assistance to be the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds
 since we are not allowed to operate foreign account. The changing of beneficiarys information/ details and other forms of documentation upon application for claim to reflect the contract money and its approvals will be secured on behalf of your company or yourself.  "
 I have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that
 should you be willing to assist us in this transaction your share as compensation will be 20% while my colleagues and I shall receive 70%
 and the balance of 10% shall be used to reimburse all expenditures
 taxes and miscellaneous expenses so incurred.  It does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of the nature described here. 
 The assumption is that your company won the major contract and subcontracted it to other companies. More often than not
 big trading companies and firms of unrelated fields win major contracts
 and subcontract to more specialized firms for execution. 
 This business itself is 100% safe
 provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality. Also your specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this mutual beneficiary transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint us. Kindly notify me for further details
 upon your acceptance of this proposal. Please send all correspondence to and response to potobo1@netscape.net 
 Regards

The Bank Manager of PACIFIC BANK PLC DAKAR-SENEGAL
Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.
 On June 6 2000
 a Chinese oil consultant / contractor with the SENEGALIS National Petroleum Corporation

 Mr. Chung Wyi made a numbered time (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months
 valued at US$13
000
000.00 (thirteen Million Dollars)in my branch.
 Upon maturity
 I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.
 After a month
 we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers
 SENEGALIS National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Chung Wyi died from an automobile accident. On further investigation

 I found out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless.
 I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Chung Wyi did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents
 including his Bank Deposit paperwork. This sum of US$13
000
000.00 is still sitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.
 No one will come forward to claim it. According to our Law
 at the expiration of 5 (five) years
 the money will revert to the ownership of the SENEGAL Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.
 "Consequently
 my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Chung Wyi so that the fruits of this old mans labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt officials."
 This is simple

 I will like you to provide me immediately with your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits
 which will put you in place as the next of kin.
 We shall employ the services of two attorneys for drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate / administration in your favor for the transfer.
 A bank account in any part of the world
 which you provide
 will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary / next of kin.
 The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you and then the remaining 10 will be maped out for any expences done before or after the transfer.
 As all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.
 If you are interested
 please reply immediately via the private email address below.
 Upon your response
 I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand.
 Please observe utmost confidentiality
and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.
 Awaiting your urgent reply via email.
 Thanks and regards

 EL.Gaily Maliky.
 Manager Pacific Bank Plc Dakar Branch.

 BARRISTER DONATUS OKOBI

My name is Mr. Micheal Ipenza
 I am an auditor in Standard Bank of South Africa . I am contacting you of a business transfer
 of a huge sum of money from a deceased account. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried
 but I am assuring you that everything has been well taken care off
 and all will be well at the end of the day.
 I decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction.
 To ease your apprehension
 I got your contact from the British chambers of commerce and industry
 foreign trade division.
 An account was open by a  foreigner named Gerald Welsh who died in an air crash along with his wife
 on the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with other passengers on board.
 PROPOSITION;
 Since his death
 none of his next-of-kin are alive to make claims for this money as his heir
 because they all died in the same accident(May his soul rest in peace). We cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.
 "Upon this discovery
 I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased
 as all documentations will be carefully worked out by a lawyer for the funds Twenty- five million United States dollars (US$25
000
000.00) in a domiciliary account to be released in your favour as the beneficiarys next of kin."
 Because after six years the money will be called back to the bank treasury as unclaimed bills and the money shared amongst the directors of the bank. so it is on this note i decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the next of kin/beneficiary to this funds rather than allow the bank directors to share this money amongst themselves at the end of the year.
 It may interest you to know that we have secured from the probate an order of mandamus to locate any of the deceased beneficiaries.
 Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business endeavor by furnishing me with the following information if you are interested.
 1.A Beneficiary name;. In order for me to prepare the PAPER WORK for transfer of the funds in your name. And also I want you to come down to South Africa to open a non-resident account for onward transfer to your overseas account
 and for us to see face to face.
 2. Details
 particulars of your contact address.
 3. Direct Telephone and fax numbers;. For our personal contact and for the confidentiality of this transactions.
 I shall be compensating you with 25% of the total sum on final
 conclusion of this project for your assistance
 as I have also thought of doling out 5% to charity organisation from your locality based on your recommendation another 5% for the services of the lawyer while the balance 65% shall be for me for investment purposes in your country as I cannot bring back this cash to my country.
 If this proposal is acceptable by you
 please endeavor to contact me immediately. Do not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed in you by informing you of this transaction from my bank as I will advise you to kindly desist from responding at all if you do NOT intend to render any assistance.
 Endeavor to respond via this my confidential direct e-mail address michealipenza@netscape.net.
 Thanks and best regards

 Mr. Micheal Ipenza.

I wish you go through this offer to consider being my partner.I am Mr.SAMSON BAMOGU .
from the republic of Sierra-Leone in west Africa
now seeking political asylum in Senegal under the (UNHCR).I got your contact through my search for a business partner.
 "In Details.My late father (Dr.MUSTAPHA BAMOGU) was the managing director of Rainbow Gold Diamond Mining company in (KEN EMA) Sierra- Leone.But was killed during the longing civil war and all his properties was totally destroyed.However
 we managed to escape with some of my fathers precious Diamonds which is presently deposited safely in a security and finance company here in Dakar."
 Now we are saddled with the problem of securing a trust worthy foreign personality to help us transfer the diamonds over to his country pending my arrival to meet with him.Furthermore
we only want this done this way because your country is politically stable for any profitable investment and if you accept our proposal
you will serve as the beneficiary of the diamonds.
 I am giving you the offers as mentioned with every confidence on your acceptance to assist us

 Good Day

 Compliments of the season to you and your family.Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Cheung Pui director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I have a obscured business suggestion for you.
 Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Major Fadi Bassem who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months
 with a value of Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him
 even during the war early this year. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.
 After further investigation it was also discovered that Major Fadi Bassem  did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So
 Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the expiration of four years (4yrs) the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.Against this backdrop
 my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi Bassem  so that you will be able to receive his funds. 
 I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi Bassem 
all that is required from you at
 this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been
 made the next of kin
 the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.
 There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall negotiate our sharing percentage and agreed on it.
 Should you be interested please send me your full names and current residential address  and I will prefers you to reach me on the email address below  (pui1900@business1.com)  and finally after that i shall provide you with more details of this operation.
 Your earliest response to this letter will be
 appreciated.
 Kind Regards

ATTENTION : REQUEST FOR BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP.
 Dear Sir/madam
 I am Mr.Donald Gage
 credit officer of IconShore Investment &amp; Finance Bank.I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.On June 6
 2002
 a British Oil consultant/contractor with the Chinese Solid Minerals Corporation
Mr.David Huckerby made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months
 valued at US$28
000
000.00 (Twenty-eight Million Dollars only) in my branch.Upon maturity
I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.
 After a month
 we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers
 the Hong Kong Solid Minerals Corporation that Mr. David Huckerby died from an automobile accident. On furtherinvestigation
 I found out that he died without making a WILL
 and allttempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.David Huckerby did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents
 including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum ofUS$28
000
000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.
 "According to Laws of Iconshore Bank
at the expiration of 5(five) years
 the money will revert to the ownership of the Federal Government
if nobody applies to claim the fund.Consequently
 my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. David Huckerby so that the fruits of this old mans labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials."
 This is simple
 I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.
 The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 25% for you and 5% for expenses incurred in the course of the transaction.There is no risk at all
as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and with my position as the credit officer guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested
 please reply immediately to my personal email box: your response
 I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.
 Please send me your confidential email and fax numbers for easy communication as my spoken english is not very good. You should observe utmost confidentiality
 and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.Awaiting your urgent reply.
 Thanks and regards
 Mr.Donald Gage.

 Sincerely yours


I know this email will reach you as a surprise
 but need not to worry as we are using the only secured and confidential medium available to seek for foreign assistance in a business. It is with heartfelt hope that I write to seek your co-operation and assistance in the context stated below: May I first introduce my self: I am Dr.(Mrs.) MARIAM ABACHA
 the wife of Late General Sani Abacha (former Military head of state and President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria) who died suddenly on 8th June 1998. I got your contact on the internet as I was making contact for a honest foreigner who will help save my life and my children
 hence our country has been frustrating us since the death of my husband. I have lost confidence with anybody within the country. Having noted the confidence reposed on your person 
 I became convinced of your capability and goodwill to assist me in receiving the sum of US$8 Million secretly willed in my favour by the late general (my husband).
 This money was kept in a Security Company in Amsterdam Holland and I have all documents with me as of when it was deposited in a Security Vault for safe keeping. This money has been defaced for Security reasons and also to avoid it been spent by unauthorized persons. it is not an ill gotten wealth rather
 it was generated from my organisation "FAMILY SUPPORT PROGRAM" (F.S.P). I will enlighten you more of this organisation if you indicate a helping interest to secure this money on my behalf. On your acceptance to render this assistance to me to invest this fund abroad in a confidential manner until we came to a conclusion to use it to buy houses and part of it will be used for non-speculative investments in your country.However
the current civilian administration of retired General Olusegun Obasanjo(The President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria) is seeking vengeance on the Abacha family because of the life prison jail sentence confirmed on him by my late husband while in office. In pursuit of this vendetta
 the present Government have resolved to freeze all known assets of General Sani Abacha including properties at home and abroad and are presently embarking on to seize the various bank accounts of my husband in Swizerland
UK
Australia. In fact
 the attack on our family (The Abacha\s) is so devastated to an extent of seizing our travelling passport 
family accounts and even trying some members of our family in court for offences allegedly committed by my late husband.
 "In view of this grievous threat to our Economic and personal survival
 our family trustee have secretly protected the will 
The Security Company has called me to do something about claiming this consignment because of the demurrage it is incurring and I told them we would come and claim it very soon. but my son seriously advised me to move the fund into an overseas accuount
 hence the reason why I have chosen you and hope that you will come to my full assistance and unlimited co-operation. In the meantime
 there is a travelling embargo on us(the whole family members) and our local accounts are seized. We are currently living on goodwill of people who believe we annot be held responsible for the sins of my late husband. In view of this plight
 I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this distressed call to save me and my children from a hopeless future. And if you agree to help
 we will compensate you sincerely for your candid effort in this regard with 25% of the total amount of $8 Million US Dollars. In that case
when the money ($8 Million) is moved into your discrete account
 you will be allowed to withdraw 25% in your favour 
while 10% has been set aside for any expenses you might incur or tax as your government may require . The remaining 65% will be invested meaningfully for my childrens future. My cousin (Dr.yemi musa) has perfected arrangements with the Trust Company concerned and has been assured 100% risk free and safe operation. What I demand from you now is to arrange to visit the Finance Company where this money is being deposited and claim it as the bona-fide owner. And in due course
 all contacts must be made through cousin Dr yemi musa whom is presently staying in Senegal through this E-mail: ma23200210@zipmail.com.br and ma232002@box.az and phone:+221-5478858.I look forward to your quick response while thanking you for your co-operation. In view of all above details
 I request you to keep this letter and co-operation highly confidential."

 Email: adamwinpoe@web-mail.com.ar
 Kindly accept my apology for sending unsolicited mail to you.  Although we have never met before but I have every reason to believe that you are a highly respected personality
 considering the fact that I sourced your profile from a human resource profile database on your country. Though
 I do not know to what extent you are familiar with events and fragile political situation in Liberia but it has formed insistent headlines in the CNN
 BBC news bulletins
 My name is Mr. Adam Winpoe from Liberia
 a Country in West Africa. My Uncle is MR JOHN Y. WINPOE
 former DEPUTY MINISTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY in LIBERIA. My uncle was falsely accused of plotting to remove the then PRESIDENT OF LIBERIA (CHARLES TAYLOR) from office. Without trial
 Charles Taylor killed him. 
 You can verify this from your country. You can also check in some of the international newspapers posted in the web sites below:
 Liberia_x.htmhttp://www.unwire.org/UNWire/20030716/449_6621.asp
 "Before he was killed
 my uncle instructed me to escape with his family to a hide out in JOHANNESBOURG SOUTH AFRICA
 and he confined on me that he left some money in a Diplomatic Trust Company in Abroad
 (name withheld for security reasons) he handed me over a certificate meant for a secret Deposit
 which he made in the Security Company. If you may ask why do I need a foreign assistance or why cant I take the cash transfer and myself? The answer is that there was an exclusion clause in the original agreement between the company and my uncle which states unambiguously that nobody
 not even himself
 can have access to the consignment in the company
 and it has to  be transferred to a foreign beneficiary outside Africa. This was done because he envisaged   his arrest and this clause were inserted to prevent any seizure or infiltration of the fund."
 My decision to contact you is therefore
 informed by this and due to my present social status and total ignorance of the business world. I believe you will appreciate the enormity of trust I repose on you by placing the fortunes of our family in your care. Permit me to request that you should reassure me that you would not let me down in any way. On my part
 this is my assurance and guarantee to you. In as much as you follow my instructions carefully
 religiously and promptly my guarantee of a hitch-free success remains unshakable. I have contacted the Diplomatic Security Firm to confirm the deposit
 which is worth $21.5Million
(Twenty-One Million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars Only) which I presumed my uncle made from the purchase of arms and ammunitions for the Liberia Army.
  Kindly include your Private Telephone and Fax numbers where you can always be reach
 Your Residential or Company Address to enable me send some other important information across to you.
 This proposal is highly restricted and should be handled as an urgent transaction requiring trust and Confidentiality.
 Thanks while looking forward to hearing from you urgently.
 Thank you.
 Sincerely

 Mr. Adam Winpoe
 For the Family.

I hope this mail meets you in good health and spirit; i am
 Rawlings Ometie
 a sierra Leonie. Presently
 I live as a refugee in republic of Ireland
 with my younger sister
 Sarah. I am the son of late Chief Dr. Wilfred Ometie
 the assassinated former assistant director Of Sierra Leone gold and Diamond-mining Corporation
 a victim of the war in my Country.
 My father was killed with other government officials during official hours when the rebel troops stormed and raided the mining   corporation office at the heat of the crisis in my country. A few weeks later
 the rebels also invaded our residential building in which my mother and two of our security men were killed in the compound while I was out for a special research program and my younger sister was in school.
 I had a singular shock and trauma
 which compelled us to flee from the country to republic of Ireland with the help of an army colonel
 who is a close friend of my late father
 I have degree in marketing and I would have further my education if not for the death of my parents. I have never worked to earn my living since my late parents had enough wealth for us.
 "I am contacting you now because of the present difficulty i am facing. Unfortunately my fathers two accounts in West Africa have recently been frozen
 however this did not affect the twenty million six hundred thousand US Dollars (us$ 20
600
000.00)
 which he deposited with a security company in UK."
 For now
 I am having every information and document needed for the collection of the deposit with the security company and i want you to act as the beneficiary of the deposit for easy and smooth collection to your account abroad for investment purposes.
 You will no doubt be adequately compensated with as well as a percentage of the profit from investment of the fund. Also you will see to it that my sister and I come over to your country at the earliest possible time. I am making this request to you with tears in my eyes and I feel that god almighty will touch you with his spirit to listen to my cry for help and answer me without delay.
 Since our Parents is no more and this is the only hope for life.
 Your positive response will give me the greatest joy and relief.
 God bless you for your kind assistance we have agreed to offer you 20% of the total sum.
  Seriously waiting for your urgent reply.

 Thank you for your prompt response.
 Lauder R.

My name is Mr. Micheal Ipenza
 I am an auditor in Standard Bank of South Africa . I am contacting you of a business transfer
 of a huge sum of money from a deceased account. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried
 but I am assuring you that everything has been well taken care off
 and all will be well at the end of the day.
 I decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction.
 To ease your apprehension
 I got your contact from the British chambers of commerce and industry
 foreign trade division.
 An account was open by a  foreigner named Gerald Welsh who died in an air crash along with his wife
 on the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with other passengers on board.
 PROPOSITION;
 Since his death
 none of his next-of-kin are alive to make claims for this money as his heir
 because they all died in the same accident(May his soul rest in peace). We cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.
 "Upon this discovery
 I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased
 as all documentations will be carefully worked out by a lawyer for the funds Twenty- five million United States dollars (US$25
000
000.00) in a domiciliary account to be released in your favour as the beneficiarys next of kin."
 Because after six years the money will be called back to the bank treasury as unclaimed bills and the money shared amongst the directors of the bank. so it is on this note i decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the next of kin/beneficiary to this funds rather than allow the bank directors to share this money amongst themselves at the end of the year.
 It may interest you to know that we have secured from the probate an order of mandamus to locate any of the deceased beneficiaries.
 Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business endeavor by furnishing me with the following information if you are interested.
 1.A Beneficiary name;. In order for me to prepare the PAPER WORK for transfer of the funds in your name. And also I want you to come down to South Africa to open a non-resident account for onward transfer to your overseas account
 and for us to see face to face.
 2. Details
 particulars of your contact address.
 3. Direct Telephone and fax numbers;. For our personal contact and for the confidentiality of this transactions.
 I shall be compensating you with 25% of the total sum on final
 conclusion of this project for your assistance
 as I have also thought of doling out 5% to charity organisation from your locality based on your recommendation another 5% for the services of the lawyer while the balance 65% shall be for me for investment purposes in your country as I cannot bring back this cash to my country.
 If this proposal is acceptable by you
 please endeavor to contact me immediately. Do not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed in you by informing you of this transaction from my bank as I will advise you to kindly desist from responding at all if you do NOT intend to render any assistance.
 Endeavor to respond via this my confidential direct e-mail address michealipenza1@netscape.net.
 Thanks and best regards

 Mr. Micheal Ipenza.

Dear Beloved in Christ

 It is by the grace of God that I received Christ
knowing the truth and the truth have set me free.Having known the truth I had no choice than to do what is lawful and right in the sight of God for eternal life and in the sight of man for witness of God´s mercy and glory upon my life.
 I am Mrs Caroline Solange Haafkens from Netherlands.I am married to Dr.Franklyn Haafkens who worked with Chevron/Texaco in Nigeria for twenty years before he died in the year 2001.We were married for twenty-seven years without a child
He died during one of the riots in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria.He was held hostage and slain to death by protesting youths of the region before his death we were both born again christians.
 Since his death I decided not to re-marry.When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of 8.6 million dollars (Eight Million six hundred thousand U.S.Dollars)with a bank in the Netherlands. Presently this money is still with the bank and the management just wrote me as the beneficiary to come forward to receive the money or rather issue a 
 letter of authorisation to somebody to receive it on my behalf if I can not come over.
  I am presently with my laptop in a hospital where I have been undergoing treatment for cancer of the lungs
 I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that I have only a few months to live.It is my last wish to see that this money is invested and at the end of every year distributed among charity organisation.
 I want a person that is God fearing that will use this money to fund churches
orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth.
 I took this decision because i know that there are alot of poor people suffering from different kind of disease and nobody to come to their aid.With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the bank.I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the new beneficiary of this fund.You will be entitled to 10% of every profit you make in a year.
 Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein.
 I await your urgent reply.
 Yours in Christ

   I MAKE THIS APPEAL WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT ANY FACTS OR OPINION EXPRESSED BY ME ARE GIVING IN CONFIDENCE AND SOLELY FOR YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND USE.
      I am Mr.Ludovic P. Johnson
the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of my  Bank. In my department I discovered an abandoned sum of US$8.5M
(Eight Million
 Five Hundred Thousand US  Dollars) with account number 14-2558-5976 that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his wife and only daughter in a plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight number 261 which crashed on 31 January
 2000. You shall read more about the crash on visiting this site http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/ The owner of this account is Mr. Morris Thompson an American and great industrialist and a resident of Alaska.
 "    It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and for our bank to release the money to you. You have to follow the instruction which I will send to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I dont want this money to go into our bank treasury as  unclaimed  bill."
   The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after Three years
 the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The money has now stayed more than  three years and I am preparing documentaion to prove that this money has been transfered to our bank treasury. It will be between me and you only that will know that the money is not transfered into our treasure. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Senegalese cannot stand
 as next of kin to a foreigner.
 In appreciation of your assistance
 I am offering you 30% of the total sum. 5% for contingencies (cost of transfer/other charges) likely to  be incurred during the course of transaction
 while the remaining 65% is  for me.
   Upon receipt of your reply
 I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application which you will complete and forward to our bank asking for this money to be paid to you as the next of kin to Mr. Morris Thomson. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.
    You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this mail through the above email or you call me on my direct telephone number 221 666 61 83.
    PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO CONTACT ME IMMEDIATELY SHOULD YOU CONSIDER MY URGENT REQUEST.

 Dear Friend
          I am Jun Cheng a manager of bills/exchange at the  foreign remittance  department of Hanivitbank. In my department
 we  discovered an  abandoned sum of  $44
700
000.00 (Forty Four Million
 Seven Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only) in an account that  belonged to one Late Mr Andrew Phillips an American
 who died along with his entire  family
 on November  1997
 in a ghastly plane crash. Since we got the  information about his death
  we have been expecting his next-of-kin to come over and file a claim as next of kin over his money because we can not release it unless somebody applied for it as next of  kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our  banking guidelines.
           Unfortunately
 nobody has come forward to claim this  money.  It is based on this that some officials in my department and I have decided to establish a cordial business relationship  with you
 hence by contacting you. We want you to present yourself as the  next of kin  to Late Mr Andrew Phillips
 so that the funds can be remitted into your account. Moreover
 we do not want the money to go into the government account as unclaimed bills. The banking law and guidelines here  stipulates that  any account abandoned or is dormant for a period of years
 is deemed closed and all money contained therein forfeited to the government treasury account.
             Now
 it is being speculated that the above sum will be transferred into the government account as an unclaimed fund on or before the end of this financial quarter of 2005
 when nobody come forward to lay claims. The reason for requesting your assistance
 is occasioned by
 the fact that the deceased (Late Mr Andrew Phillips) was a foreigner
 and we have access to his detailed bio data which you will hold as a weapon to present yourself as the next of kin to Late Mr Andrew Phillips.
           The mode of sharing after a successful transfer of the money into your account
 shall be 70% to my colleagues and I
 for the role you will be expected to play in this deal
 we have agreed to give you 25% of the total sum and 5% for the expenses we are going to encounter by the two parties in the course of this transaction. Therefore
you are expected to reply this letter indicating your readiness and interest to participate in this business. After receiving your reply
 you will be communicated to with the exact steps to take. I expect your urgent response and I shall contact you for further discussion on this matter
to enable us conclude this transaction urgently without any delay or hitch. Please treat this business proposal as strictly confidential for security reasons considering my official position in Bank of Korea.

 to approve or deny the request.
 My name is James William
 a Manager with the above bank located in Nigeria
 West Africa. I have a proposal for your consideration and will be glad if you would give your co-operation so that we could exploit the opportunity together.
 The agent of an oversea penticostal church opened an account with our bank at the time of establishment some years back. The account is for the purpose of receiving support donations for the church.
 Curiously
 this account was only operated for one year and abandoned. For the past years
 donations have been pouring into the account from ignorant donors. I investigated and found out that the church opened similar bank accounts in many countries and as it grew
 some of the accounts were abandoned especially in countries where the church had no physical presence. It was also discovered that some of the evangelist/agents overseeing the accounts were disgruntled at how church finances were managed and had
 to leave the church.
 I have been monitoring this bank account for some years; - from the time when there was only US$500
000 in the account to now when the account has over US$15Million. The interesting thing is that the donations are unanimous; so even the donors keep their identity secret. I and my top colleagues at the bank have agreed to treat this money as an abandoned account. They mandated me to source for a foreign partner to whom the bank could bequeath the money for charity.
 The financial laws of Nigeria is liberal in this respect as it permits the banks to bequeath such abandoned bank accounts to individuals or organizations that will use the fund for charitable courses.
 My reason for writing you is to solicit your co-operation so that you could
 be presented as the individual to whom this money will be bequeathed. We propose a 50/50 sharing arrangement between you and the CONTINENTAL BANK GROUP. If you accept
 please confirm to me by a return email so that I can brief you on how we can harness this
 opportunity to our mutual benefit. You should also provide me with your telephone
 number to enable me call you.
 Accept my best wishes as I await your positive reply.</p>

 Mutual Trust
 Blessings to you.
 I am the above named person but now undergoing medical treatment now. I am married to Dr.Waltner De Matinez who worked with angolan embassy in mexico for over nine years before he died in the year 2002.
 We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians.Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against.When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of$27.6Million (twenty-seven million six hundred thousand U.S. Dollars) with one finance/security company in Europe.
 Presently
 this money is still with the Security Company. Recently
 my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to church or better still a christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want a church or individual to that will use this to fund churches
 orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of the lord is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth.
 I took this decision because I don`t have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don`t want my husbands hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I dont want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner
 hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know  where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bossom of the Lord.
 Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I dont need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health
and because of the presence of my husbands relatives around me always. I dont want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the  Finance/Security Company Europe. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will empower you as the original- beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shephard. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life.
 Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a church or christian individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to hear from you.
 please reply me through my private email;
 &lt;martinez4charity@yahoo.com&gt;
 Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.

With due respect
 trust and humility I write this letter to you seeking your help and assistance though it s difficult
 since we have not met before. I believe that you are capable and reliable in handling this urgent
 international transaction of this sort. I am VIVIAN KABA
 the dougher of comrade TOMSIN KABA
 the Zimbabwean former Minister for Youth &amp; Gender Equality who is also a businessman and politician
 in the Zimbabwean political arena. My father was the famous politician who stood firm against President
 "Mugabe s idea of continuous seizure of White farms and the distribution of it to the blacks without compensation to the owners. Because of my fathers stand in this issue
 he was killed on the 14th April 2001 by a planned motor accident along Mashonaland in Western Mashona province of Zimbabwe
 the planners of the accident are said"
 to be dissidents soldiers suspected to have the backing of the government and President Mugabe. Sir
 when this accident occurred at about 10:15 am Zimbabwean time my
 father did not die on the spot rather he was rushed to Harare hospital by some members of the opposition group.
 Sensing that if my father dies we shall be the next target
 my mother in her sick condition managed under special arrangements by some UDM members (the opposition group) managed to sneak us out of Zimbabwe to DAKAR SENEGAL where we are to seek asylum. It was at this stage that my mother confided in me that my father
 before he died
 had released certain documents to her. One of these documents is the main reason iam writing this letter to you
 and it concerns a deposit of one diplomatic box my father concealed with one of the private security company here in dakar containing US$15M (fifteen million
 united states dollars) declared as family valuables
 and other vital
 documents which was meant for his political campaign in the past election march 2002. We are now in DAKAR SENEGAL with the original documents of deposit intact
 and because of the existing law
 which prevents asylum seekers / refugee like us to operate an account that exceeds US$1000.00 and at the same time
 there is no way we can comfortably transfer this money abroad for safe keeping and investment without assistance from someone overseas
 I decided to write to you seek for your help for this money to be transferred into your private bank account
 as all arrangements for a hitch free transfer have been fully taken care of. I want to a ssure you also that this transaction is 100% risk free as no other person knows this box apart from my younger borther and i as my
 mother .Sir
 as for your reward kind assistance we have resolved to give you 20% of the total amount
 5% will be set aside for any expenses that might be incurred in the course of this transaction. We planned to invest the rest of the money in your country under your guidance. If you are willing to help us
 try as much as possible to reach me with the above number for more briefing
 and also
 to enable us proceed in earnest towards concluding the transfer. However you will be kind enough to give me
 your private number
 I will be glad to call you. Sir
 bear in mind that our lives depend on this fund and we do hope
 that this money will be safe when finally transferred into your account. I do hope to establish a rewardi ng and good relationship with you and your family after this transaction. Hoping to hear from you as soon as possible. Thanks for your co-operation and God bless. Best regards

 MR. KARIM SULE
 ECO BANK MOROCCO PLC.

I am writting this letter with due respect and heartful of tears since we have not known or met ourselves previously I am asking for your assistance after I have gone through a profile that speaks good of you.
 "I want to find out if its possible for you to deal with individual as to investment ."
 "I came across your profile and I feel its highly reputable that is why I pick an interest getting across to you in respect of investment at my disposal ."
 I be will so glad if you can allow me and lead me to the right channel towards your assistance to my situation now.
 I will make my proposal well known if I am given the opportunity.
 I would like to use this opportunity to introduce myself to you.
 Well I am Mr Cyriel Kelvin from Liberia
the only son of Col
 Kelvin Onwun
 My father is now late
he died some months back during the last and current crisis in my country(Liberia).
 He was one of the high officers in the leadership of formal president Charles Taylor who is now in exile after many innocent soul were killed 
My father was unlucky to be one among those that were killed by the rebel.
 The main reason why I am contacting you now is to seek you assistance in the area of my future investment and also for a help hand over some huge amount of money in my possession.
 This money (US 8.5 Million) was deposited in a security and finance company in Europe some years ago by my father.
 He made me the sole beneficiary.
 I am now asking you to stand on my behalf to make this claim and also l want you to stand as my partner oversea and in time of the investment as well.
 As I have mention earlier I will make the procedure to this issue to be well known to you if I am given the opportunity to do so.
 Pls attach your direct and full information .
 Mr Cyriel Kelvin.

      I am Barrister Omoego Darris
 an International Legal Practitioner and a Consultant to Mr. Shouwkat Kahlil
 a Lebanese Importer of Textiles and Automobiles
 based in Cotonou
Republic of Benin for the past twenty years. Unfortunately
 my client Mr Shouwkat Kahlil was one of the passengers that died in the ill-fated plane crash involving a Boeing 727 UTA chartered flight that took off from Cotonou
 Republic of Benin and crashed into the Atlantic ocean on Thursday
 25 December 2003. For details of the plane crash
please visit :
 http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/12/26/benin.crash/index.html
 Before the untimely death of my client
 he had through a security company here in Cotonuo moved the sum of US$20.5m to Europe and was to
 "proceed to Netherlands immediately after the Holiday to complete arrangements and have this money Deposited into ABN AMRO BANK and already the security company where the funds was deposited has sent notice to me requesting that this funds should be claimed by the depositor (My Client) or his next of kin within 14 working days
 else the fund will be forfeited to the state. I must confess to you that if I do not find a way to bring this fund out of the Finance Company
 I will be doing the greatest injustice to my late friend and his family. this is why I decided to you to stand in as a next of kin or his business partner who was supposed to receive the funds for investment in Europe. There are no risks involved as I am the only person who has access to my clients documents. The Finance firm has just sent a reminder to my client through me
 informing him of the maturity of his fund. Your compensation for your assistance in securing the fund is subject to negotiations. I need the following information from you. Your full names
address
telephone and Fax numbers. Also Copy of your Identification. Reply urgently
 as we must conclude this transaction within the next 14 working days Sincerely

I know this mail may come to you as a surprise
considering the fact that we have not known ourselves before.Nevertheless
i need your urgent attention towards my desperate needs of your help to establish a good investment in your country under your control.I am Langley Williams

 the son of late Chief Joseph Alfred Williams who was a business man and Ex-Manager of Sierra Leone mining corperation (S.L.M.C.) Mande district of my country Sierra-Leone.I am writing to
 seek for your assistance to help me receive the sum of Seven million eight hundred thousand United States dollars (us$7
800
000.00) deposited in a security and finance firm senegal
 inside a safe box as Diamond and precious Stone by my late father.
 According to my father
this money was the income accrued from over invoiced sales from the corperation.During the civil war between the rebel forces of major Paul Koroma and the combined forces of ECOMOG peace keeping operations that almost destroyed my country

 following the forceful removal from power of the Civilian Elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah by the rebels and by the indiscriminate looting of public and Government properties by the rebel forces
 the sierra Leone mining corperation was one of the targets looted and destroyed.
 My father including other top Government functionaries were attacked and killed by the rebels because of his relationship with the civilian Government of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
 "As a result of my fathers death
and the news of my uncles involvement in an air crash
our hope of survival was dashed. The untimely deaths of my father and Uncle caused my mothers heart failure and other related complications which later led to her sudden death.

 Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr.Cheung Pui director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I have an urgent business suggestion for you.
 I honestly apologize and hope I do not cause you much embarrassment by contacting you through this means for a transaction of this magnitude
but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium.
 Furthermore
due to this issue on my hands now
it became necesary for me to seek your assistance
 and it is imperativefor me to know your opinion
 Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Major Fadi Bassem who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months
with a value of Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him
 even during the war early this year.Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.
 After further investigation it was also discovered that Major Fadi Basem  did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So
 Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. 
 What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration 6 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. 
 I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem
all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin
 the attorney will also file in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.
 There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going to adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning thisissue.Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me
 25% for you and 5% for any expenses incure during the transaction. Should you be interested please send me your full names and current residential address and I will prefer you to reach me via my box

 (cheungp600@yahoo.com.hk) and finally after that i shall provide you with more details of this operation.
 Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.

 Dear Sir/Madam
 
 "You may be surprise to receive this letter from me as you dont know me in person
 but please take this mail into consideration. I am Mr. Nicholas Kular
 the son of   late Mr. JOHNSON KULAR
 who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. Kindly work with me to handle a very confidential transaction which involves a transfer of fund to a foreign account and I decided to write you
 my late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agents of the ruling government of president Robert Mugabe for his alleged support and sympathy for the Zimbabwean opposition party controlled by the white minority. "
 Before his death
 he had earlier taken  to South Africa the sum of US$ 26.5 Million (Twenty -Six Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars)  which he deposited with a Security Company as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was deposited in a box as VALUABLES AND PERSONAL EFFECTS to avoid much demurrage from the Security Company. 
 This money was for purchase of new machinery and chemical for farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland. 
 This land problem arose when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land act that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the "modus operandi" adopted by the government. This resulted to rampant killing and mob action by the war veterans and some political thugs. Precisely
 More than thirty-eight (38) people have so far been killed. Heads of governments from the west
 especially Britain and United States of America have voiced their condemnation of Mugabe\splan. Subsequently
 South African Development Community (S.A.D.C) has continuously supported Mugabe\s new land act
 it is against this background that I and my family who are currently residing in South Africa have decided to transfer my Father\s money into a foreign account. As the eldest son of my Father
 I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are tactically freezing
   our family wealth and South Africa\s government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of investing this money in South Africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have almost the same political history. More so
 the South African Foreign Exchange policy does not allow such investment hence we are seeking for an "ASYLUM". As a business person whom I entrusted my future and that of my family into his hands
 I must let you know that this transaction is 100% risk-free and the nature of your business does not necessarily matter. For your assistance
 we are offering you 20% of the total sum
 75% for me and my family while 5% will be mapped out for any expenses we may be incured during the course of this transaction. We wish to invest our part of the money on commercial property based on your advice. 
 Finally
 all i want from you is assurance that you will not betray my trust. If this appeal  is acceptable to you
 please confirm your interest via the above telephone number or better still email. 
 Best Regards. 
 Mr.Nicholas Kular (For the Family).

 Dear Friend 
 Please Permit me to contact you through this medium. I am Barrister Tunji Bello
 a solicitor at-law. I was the personal attorney to one of my late clients that used to work with an indigenous company here in my country.In summer 2001
 my client
 his wife and their three children were involved in an auto-crash while on a picnic-trip. Unfortunately
 all occupants of the vehicle lost their lives. 
 Since then I have made several enquiries to his embassy to locate any of my clients extended relatives and this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts
 I decided to contact you over Internet. 
 I have contacted you to assist in receiving and accommodating the money left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank where these huge deposits were lodged. My deceased client had an account balance with his bank valued at about US$9.9million
 and I have been issued a notice as his attorney to provide his next of kin or have the account confiscated. 
 "Since I have been unsuccessful in locating my clients relatives; I now seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of my deceased client so that the proceeds of his account (US$9.9million) can be paid to you. You and I can then share the money 60% to me and 40% for you. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us seeing this project through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate/risk-free arrangement that will protect you and me from any breach of the law. "

 Since his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $5.5Million (Five Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars) in one of the Security Company here in Abidjan.
 Recently
 my Doctor told me that I have serious sickness which is cancer problem. The one that disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to a church or individual that will utilize it the way I am going to instruct herein.
 "I want a God fearing person that will use this fund for orphanage Homes
 widows
 propagating the word of God and to endeavour that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that Blessed is the hand that gives
 I took this decision because I dont have any child that will inherit this money and I don t want my husbands efforts to be wasted or abandoned or a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly way."
 Due to my health conditions
 I have forwarded all the necessary documents required for this fund released to the Security Company and also an Authority Letter Directing the Security Company to release this deposited family treasure to you as soon as you Identify yourself to the Security Company as the deposited family treasures recipient.
 Kindly contact the Security Company and request for this deposited family treasure as I have directed you.

 along with his entire family as a result of an automobile crash. Since his death none of his relations or next-of-kin has come forward to lay claims for this money as the heir
 this is the basically the reason why I have contacted you. We cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our operating guidelines. 
 It is upon this discovery I now humbly request your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased
 so that the funds can be released in your favor as the beneficiary next of kin. I shall compensate you with 30% of the total sum for your assistance.
 Please
 if this proposal is acceptable by you
 kindly get back to me via my private email address provided below and furnish me with your full name

 I shall bring to your knowledge detailed information on how this deal would be transacted.

 I am a staff of Lloyds TSB Group attached in Private Banking Services. I am contacting you concerning a customer and
 an investment placed under our banks management 3 years ago
 I contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication and I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you.
 \xa0In 2000
 the subject matter; ref: bb/tsb/bank/73 came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our Private Banking Services Department. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 8.35 million United States Dollars
 which he wished to have us turn over on his behalf. I was the officer assigned to his case; I made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chief operations officer of the Private Banking Services Department
 especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank. We met on numerous o
 cater for banking and statutory charges. He complained about the charges but later came around when I explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us. Cash movement across borders has become especially strict since the incidents of 9/11.
 \xa0I contacted my affiliate in Europe and had the funds available in main land Europe. I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise instructions to the latter and had the funds deposited in a security consultancy firm
 the firm is a specialist private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and well-connected organizations. In line with instructions
 the money was deposited. He told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we had
  those wh
 o patronize our services usually prefer anonymity
 but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form
 he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking
 opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence
 accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself
 ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I said
 rarely do they nominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care.
 \xa0What I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and
 u as the closest surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit
 I am prepared to share the money with you in half and no more. That is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you. We share the proceeds 50/50.I would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me
 but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit. But on the other hand
 would easily pass as the beneficiary solo with the rights to claim. I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you in a few days. I will simply inform our bank of the final closing of the file relating to the customer. I will then officially communicate with the finance company and instruct them to release the deposit to you. With these two things: all is done. The alternative would be for us to have the firm direct the funds to another bank with you as account holder. This way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from the firm. We can fine-tune this
 "y life but do not destroy me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. I am the only one who knows of this situation
 good fortune has blessed you with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life. Lets share the blessing. If you find yourself able to work with me
 contact me through this email account:jamesalfred@i12.com. If you give me positive signals
 I will initiate this process towards a conclusion. I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels; I will deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat
 I do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through this email address:jamesalfred@i12.com.\xa0 I do not want any direc"

\xa0\xa0\xa0 We as holders of sensitive positions in our various parastatal
 were
 mandated by the federal government to scrutinise all payments made to foreign contractors
 and discovered that some of the contracts they executed were grossly over invoiced
 either by omission or commission. Also
 we discovered that the sum of $33
000
000.00(thirty three million American dollars only) was lying in a suspense account
 although the foreign contractors were fully paid their entitlements after executing the said contracts. We all agreed that the over-invoiced amount be transferred into a bank account provided by a foreign partner
 as the code of conduct of federal civil service does not allow us to operate foreign accounts.
 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 However
 we have suceeded in transferring some of the monies
 precisely US$7.5(Seven million five Hundred American Dollars) into a foreign account in Morocco (North Africa)
 but unfortunately the provider of the account has severed all forms of communication with us as he has refused to adhere to our earlier mutual agreement
 insisting tha the total amount be paid into his nominated bank account before disbursement will take effect.
 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 We are therefore seeking your assistance based on the balance amount US$25.5M which can be speedily processed and fullyremitted into your nominated bank account. On successful remittance of the funds into your account
 you will be compensated with 20% of the amount for your assistance and services.
 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 This transaction is closely knitted and in view of our sensitive
 positions we cannot afford a slip. I assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free.We will avail you with our identities as regards our respective office when relationship is fully established and smooth operation commences.
 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I am at your disposition to entertain any questions from you in respect of this transaction
 so
 contact me immediately through the above email address for further information on the requirements and procedure.
 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Please note that this is a DEAL and confidentiality is of very great
 importance for security reasons.

 I am in a secret private home recovering from very fatal injuries and I have lost my ability to talk and to hear clearly based on the severe torture I underwent in the hands of agents of state."
 The document of the above funds in question was handed over to me by Mr. Alexei Pichugin to be used in payment for his last oil deal with Yukos Oil Co. Already the funds have been deposited with a prime Bank where the final crediting is expected to be carried out. While I was on this process

 In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of £12.5million British Pounds Sterling (Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand British Pounds Sterling) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers Late Mr. Morris Thompson an American who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines
 Flight 261
 which crashed on January 31 2000
 including his wife and only daughter. You shall read more about the crash on visiting this website.
 http://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.html
 Since we got information about his death
 we have been expecting his next of kin or relatives to come over and claim his money because the Bank cannot release the funds unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.
 "Unfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin being his only daughter died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the knowledge of this fund behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and two other officials in this department now decided to do business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin or beneficiary of the funds for safe keeping and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want this money to go back into Government treasury as unclaimed bill."
 We agreed that 20% of this money would be for you as foreign partner
 while the balance will be for my colleagues and I. We will visit your country for the disbursement according to the percentages indicated above once this money gets into your account.  Please be honest to me as trust is our watchword in this transaction.
 Please note that all necessary arrangement for the smooth release of these funds to you has been finalized. We will discuss much in details when I do receive your response.
 Please in your response include your telephone and fax numbers for a better communication between us.
 You can reach me on the email below

 Dear Friend

 First
 I must solicit your confidence in this transaction.This is by virtue of its nature as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL AND TOP SECRET. However after series of petition was recieved by this present regime from foreign contractors and inability of the BANK OF AFRICA (BOA)to fulfill their obligation for the payment to its foreign creditors
 in conjunction with the council of ministers
 they mandated us to carry out a careful and comprehensive review of all overdue payments to foreign contractors and to effect payments immediately.
 During the above mentioned process
 we discovered an abandoned sum of US$10.M (Ten million US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his
 entire famil in a plane crash that happened in Kenya
 East Africa.
 Since we got information about his death
 we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.
 Please I want you to visit the website below for more information about the Plane Crash:
 It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and
 "subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill."
 I agree that 40% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner
 in respect to the provision of a foreign account
and 50% would be for me
 while 10% will be for expenses incure during the transaction. There after I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentage indicated.
 Therefore
 to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged
 you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name
 your bank account number
 your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location wherein the money will be remitted.
 Upon the receipt of your reply
 I will send to you by email the text of the application to fill and send to the bank. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free risk and this transaction will only take us
 14 banking days because as a banker
 I know what to do and move the fund into your account without any delay and thatyou should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangement have been made for the transfer.
 You should contact me as soon as you receive this letter so that I will send you the text of the application to apply to the bank.
 Yours faithfully.
 MR ISIAKA AKIDA
 Bill &amp; Exchange Manager


Greetings. 
 I strongly regret any inconvenience the receipt of this letter may 
 cause you
 bearing in mind the nature of its content coming from a 
 person without any referral
 but please read and assimilate its content and objectively consider if we can work together. 
 I am the head of the account department of a Private Bank in the United Kingdom and I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you. 
 "This involves a client who had an investment placed under our banks management years ago
 the circumstances surrounding the investment made by this client who died interstate
 with no known nominated successor in title over this investment made with the Private Banking Branch of my bank has made it very difficult to locate anyone who is directly related to the deceased. "
 With the very strong feeling that no one will ever come forward to 
 claim the funds and the investigation coming to a close after several months
 the need for an assistance becomes crucial
 as a next of kin to the depositor is earnestly being searched for
 I have already developed a foolproof
 legal and totally risk free means through which the fund can be released to your nominated bank account within a very short time after due documentation and authentication process. 
 The strategy is to use my position and influence as the Head of the branch and Personal Account officer of the deceased to present you as a next of Kin and beneficiary of the deposit. I want to assure you that I have concluded all local modalities for the successful completion of this within 10 banking days of your agreement to proceed with me as the required assistance is perfected to be 100% risk free. Please reply me to enable us proceed. 
 I expect your urgent response and if in the affirmative
 I shall advice you on what we need to do.
 Best regards
 
 Frank Jones.

 which posed a threat to President Putin Leadership
 and was charged with Tax invasion
 just to get him out of the way.
 The Russian Government had already concluded plans to frozen all the accounts in my boss name (Mikhail Khodorkovsky) both corporate and personal before I connived with an high ranked official of YUKOS OIL
(who is also my partner in this business) to raise a memo stating that YUKOS OIL owe a foreign contractor the sum of 23m US dollars which was finally approved for payment after some deliberations
 by the Government of Russia.
 YOUR ROLE:
 My contact in Yukos Oil will present you as the foreign beneficiary of the above stated sum. He will also arrange for the documentation which the payment center will need to transfer the sum to you.
 The business is 100% safe

 Dear Sir

 No doubt the letter might come as a surprise to you. I am Mr. PRINCE WILL NKOMO 
 the son of late Mr. HARRY NKOMO
 one of the major victims in the on going crisis in Zimbabwe. You might have heard or read about it
 you can visit www.cnn.com\\zimbabwe. I obtained your contact privately and after due consideration and prayers decided to contact you for assistance to transfer and invest our family fund.
 My country Zimbabwe is in real war with no end sight
 the president Mr. Robert Mugabe  introduced a new land reform act meant to deprive and relocate all the major farms in Zimbabwe
 this now resulted in the Zimbabwe war veterans and black mob killing
 looting and displacing the entire farm in Zimbabwe
 many has been killed and my father was one of the major  victims
 as we own one of the biggest farm in our country.
 Shortly before his death
 he took to South Africa with my mother to deposit the sum of US$20
000
000.00(TWENTY  MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) into a security and finance company in South Africa. It was deposited as a family valuables to avoid attention and high demurrage payment because this money was actually for the building of an ultra modern farms with all the machineries such as pipe-born water
 electricity chemicals etc. only that he did not survive to realize this
 May His Gentle Soul Rest In Peace.
 "Now faced with this situation
 we decided to exile to South Africa with the rest of the family where we have awaited for things to cool down and have successful claims to the funds .I have in my mothers possession all the necessary documents as regards to the deposit of this fund."
 We had planned to invest this money in South Africa
 but because of our status as asylum seekers
 the financial laws in South Africa does not allow asylum seekers any investment and financial rights not even to operate a bank accounts in the country until asylum is approved which still pending
 more so the nearness of South Africa and my country is not safe for us without a reliable bank account into which we can transfer this money. 
 Do understand to provide a suitable account to transfer this fund for our resettlement and investments. Can you handle this fund without any problem in your country
 if so do contact me on my telephone no as soon as possible for further arrangement as regards to our working plans.
 Thanks and God bless as I await your sincerely response.

I am writting this letter with due respect and heartful of tears since we have not known or met ourselves previously I am asking for your assistance.
 "I want to find out if its possible for you to deal with individual as to investment ."
 "I came across your profile and I feel its highly reputable that is why I pick an interest getting across to you in respect of investment at my disposal ."
 I be will so glad if you can allow me and lead me to the right channel towards your assistance to my situation now.
 I will make my proposal well known if I am given the opportunity.
 I would like to use this opportunity to introduce myself to you.
 Well I am Mr Cyril Kelvin from Liberia
the only son of Col
 Kelvin Onwun
 My father is now late
he died some months back during the last and current crisis in my country(Liberia).
 He was one of the high officers in the leadership of formal president Charles Taylor who is now in exile after many innocent soul were killed 
My father was unlucky to be one among those that were killed by the rebel.
 The main reason why I am contacting you now is to seek you assistance in the area of my future investment and also for a help hand over some huge amount of money in my possession.
 This money (US 8.5 Million) was deposited in a security and finance company in Europe some years ago by my father.
 He made me the sole beneficiary.
 I am now asking you to stand on my behalf to make this claim and also l want you to stand as my partner oversea and in time of the investment as well.
 As I have mention earlier I will make the procedure to this issue to be well known to you if I am given the opportunity to do so.
 Pls attach your direct and full information .
 Mr Cyril Kelvin.

I am pleased to introduce a business opportunity to you to transfer to your overseas account a huge amount of money deposited in one of the Prime Banks here in Dakar-Senegal. I urgently want to know you and if you are capable of handling and accomodate this magnitude of funds until I resign and come over to join you for an investment in your country. What I need is a reliable and honest individual/organisation that would be capable and fit enough to provide either an existing bank account or set up a new Bank Account immediately to receive this funds. Even an empty bank account can serve to receive this funds as long as you will remain honest to me till we actualise this interest.
 My name is Dr. Salif Mamadou
 the Director of Bill and Exchange at the Foreign Remittance Department of the same bank. I am writing following the impressive information about you through one of my friends who runs a consultancy firm. He assured me of your capability and reliability to champion this business opportunity.
 In my department we discovered an abandoned Sum of $18.5M USD Eighteen Million
 Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars)
 in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers an American by name: Mr.Neal Walker who died along with other passengers in EgyptAir Flight 990 - October 31
 1999. We have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased and the person must be foreigner as indicated in our banking guidelines. Futher investigation
 we discovered that the owner of the account died without a [Heir/WILL] hence the money is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing.
 It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in bank now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we do not want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years
 the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury account as unclaimed fund.
 The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and I can not stand as next of kin to a foreigner
it is also against our the banking law
 guideline and ethics of banks here in my country. We have agreed that 20 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner
 in respect to the provision of a foreign account
 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 70 % would be for me and my colleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.
 Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as requested to provide the following: Your full name and address
 Your direct telephone and fax number and your bank information. All the requested information will enable me perfect all the necessary things in your favour for smooth transfer of the fund into you account as you will provide.
 If you are interested
 please contact me via my email address: m_salif@yahoo.com &lt;mailto:m_salif@yahoo.com&gt; and also call me on my telephone for more details: 00221 699.9741. Upon your response
 I shall provide you with more details on how we shall proceed with the claims. I expect you to observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be profitable for both of us without any risk involved.
 Awaiting your urgent reply.

Good day to you.
 I got your contact while searching for investment assistance in chamber of commerce in your country. I am Mr. Kenneth Malfred a 24 years old boy. The first son of (late) Dr. Godwin Malfred 
whom was managing director J &amp; D Oil company in (MONROVIA) Liberia West Africa. But he was killed along side with my younger brother during the longing civil war by rebels and all our properties was totally destroyed.
 Before the death of my father
 he deposited an amount of Eight million five hundred thousand American dollars (U.S. $ 8.500

 I was mandated to seek and arrange with a trusted foreign National who can assist us in transferring the above state amount out of Nigeria.Now that all the contracts have been paid following the completion and commissioning of the various contract

 foreign firms
 only a foreign firm can make claims or as a beneficiary for the purpose of transferring the money out of Nigeria.We have unanimously agreed to compensate you with 35% of the total sum ( US$32.5Million ) if you are willing to render us your assistance as regards the transfer. It was also agreed that 5% shall be set aside to offset incidental expenses that might be incurred by either of us course of offsetting this transfer. The remaining 60% shall be our due share.All necessary arrangements required for a speedy conclusion of this transaction have been put in place with top officials of the Nigeria Federal Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Nigeria to enable us conclude the 
 whole transaction within a very shortspace of time.What is required of you is 
 first to furnish us with the following through my email address.
 3.)Your private / official telephone and fax number.While promising you a 
 smooth and hitch -free transfer of this fund into the account nominated by you

My Dear Friend

  My name is Dr. Ben Mboye
 a Uganda national. I was the Permanent Secretary of Defense &amp; Accounting Officer in Uganda. One of my reasons for contacting you is to share my joy with you that I have been exonerated and cleared by Hon Justice Julie Sebuntinde from the probe that involves three junk Chopper Helicopter purchased from Russia. My second reason is to ask you about the possibility of investing in your country that I believe we can embark upon together.
  Due to the strong campaign by President Yowery Museveni to subdue the rebel forces of Joseph Kony in my country
 directive was given in 1997 for the need to purchase some fresh arms and ammunitions abroad
 which includes 3 MI-24 Chopper Helicopter Gunship that have night vision and anti-missile devices from Russian. When my superiors in authority concluded the negotiation for the purchases
 I was told to prepare a ?contract? for the purchases of the Helicopters
 which I did as the Permanent Secretary of Defence and Accounting Officer. It will amaze you to hear that after the Belarusian suppliers delivered the three MI-24 Helicopters to Uganda
 inspection was carried out and it was discovered that the three MI-24 helicopters were junks. Further investigation revealed that Lt. Gen. Salim Saleh who is a younger brother to the President and his Aide-de-Camp (Mr. Ruyondo) connived with the Russian company to supply helicopter that are almost out of service (junks) and they were not overhauled for selfish financial
  gains.
  When Hon Justice Julie Sebuntinde probed the case
 a report was released stating that The Chief of Logistics and Engineering
 The Minister of State for Defence and myself have been exonerated and cleared from the offence.   Nevertheless
 I lost my job and was prohibited from participating in public services.
  PLEASE NOTE: In my long years of service to my country
 I was able to acquire valuable fixed assets and substantial amount of money. Why the probing of the case was going on
 I was advised by my Lawyer to sell off all my acquired properties that worth million of American dollars and also to withdraw my money from my bank account to save them from being frozen and confiscated. Due to the necessity for to lie low
 I delegated power to my closest aide Mr. Steve Charles to be in charge of my projects.
  The money realized from the sales of my properties was added to the money that was withdrawn from my account and the total amount was US$15
500
000.00 (Fifteen Million
 Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Since I could not lodge this fund into any bank account for fear of being traced
 the money was packaged and deposited with a Security Company that belong to a German national
 based in South Africa for safekeeping. The funds are security coded and well packaged in a sealed luggage to prevent them from knowing the content. Arrangement is going on for the money to be moved from its current location to an affiliate security company in Europe by Mr. Steve Charles who is currently in europe to transact this business with you since I want my identity to be kept out of the money.
  What I want from you at this moment is to indicate your interest and willingness to receive this money for investment purposes in your country. You are going to work hand-in-hand with Mr. Steve Charles whom is to represent my interest in this transaction
 He is currently in europe. As soon as you receive this email
 you are advised to contact him on his email address: stvchar1@netscape.net .He will let you know the modalities to claim the funds and also give you his phone number when you contact him. You will assist me in the investment of this money
 but I will not want my identity revealed. I will also want to buy properties and stocks in multi-national companies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments with your assistance. At this point
 I want to emphasise the high level of confidentiality
 which this business demands and hope you will not betray the trust and confidence that I repose on you. l will render you 25% of this money and 5% will go for other expenses. . You ca
  n also reach me true Mr Steve Charles
  As you already know
 time is of great essence in this transaction
 kindly confirm your telephone and fax number  to Mr. Steve Charles. Bear in mind that this project can be concluded within five days if you are prompt in your response.
  Kind personal regards


With due respect I like to disclose a mutual transaction to you. I am Donald Duke
 The Manager
 International Diplomatic Cargo Services.
 We have consignment valued US$21
000
000.00 (Twenty-One Million United State Dollars) in our custody
 deposited by a customer from Congo Democratic Republic (Zaire).
 Our computer data system currently shows that the beneficiary of the deposited consignment died in an Air Crash early June 2003.Until date we have not received any notification from his relatives for claiming of the deposited consignment. Also the relatives have till the end of this accounting year to lay claims or the consignment becomes the property of the company.

 Dear Sir/Madam
 I am Mr.Mpho George
 manager of bills/exchange at the foreign remittance department of ABSA Bank. In my department
 we discovered an abandoned sum of US$14
700
000.00(Fourteen Million
 Seven Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only) in an account that belonged to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family
 on November 1996
 in a ghastly plane crash
 and he happened to be a Foreigner Since we got the information about his death
 we have been expecting his next-of-kin to come over and claim his money because we can not release it unless somebody applied for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Unfortunately
 nobody has come forward to claim this money. It is based on this that some officials in my department and I have decided to establish a cordial business relationship with you
 hence by contacting you. We want you to present yourself as the next of kin through your relation with the deceased
 so that the funds can be remitted into your account. Moreover
 we do not want the money to go into the government account as unclaimed bills. The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that any account abandoned or is dormant for a period of years
 is deemed closed and all money contained therein forfeited to the government treasury account. Now
 it is being speculated that the above sum will be transferred into the government account as an unclaimed fund on or before the end of this financial quarter of 2005
 when nobody come forward to lay claims. The reason for requesting you to present yourself as next of kin
 is occasioned by
 the fact that the deceased (customer) was a foreigner
 and we have access to his detailed bio data which you will hold as a weapon to present yourself as the next of kin. The mode of sharing after a successful transfer of the money into your account
 shall be 70% to my colleagues and I
 for the role you will be expected to play in this deal
 we have agreed to give you 25% of the total sum and 5% for the expenses we are going to encounter by the two parties in the course of this transaction. Therefore
 you are expected to reply this letter indicating your readiness and interest to participate in this business. After receiving your reply
 you will be communicated to with the exact steps to take. I expect your urgent response through my email address roonyrian@webmail.co.za .And I shall contact you for further discussion on this matter
 to enable us conclude this transaction urgently without any delay or hitch. Please treat this business proposal as strictly confidential for security reasons considering my official position in ABSA Bank. Regards

 it is being speculated that the above sum will be transferred into the government account as an unclaimed funds.
 The mode of sharing after a successful transfer of the money into your account shall be determine by me and you during the cause of your Phone call
 to know how much you will like to take. But you should know that we have already set outside 5% of the total sum for any miscellaneous expenses we may encounter in the course of this transaction.

 which give you a claim to the funds.  I also will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the movement of the money. You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.

Kindest Attention:
 My name is Mr. Dave Benton
 I am from Portugal .  I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment
 and right now I have only about a few months to live
 according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well
 as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself)but my business.  Though I am very rich
 I was never generous
 I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I  cared for.But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it.
 Now that God has called me
 I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as few close friends .I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so
 I have decided to give alms to charity organizations
 as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far
 I have Distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E
 Somalia and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly
 I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of  my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan
 they refused and kept the money to themselves. 
 Hence
 I do not trust them anymore
 as they seem not to be contended with what I  have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Thirty  Million United States Dollars($30
000
000
00) that I have with an Asset Management Company Abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatch it to charity organizations.
 N/B:Kindly note that  35% of this funds must go to the tsunami victims
60% to other Charity Organization and 5%  for your effort and time.
 I cannot talk with you on the phone due to my health situation
 as I am using my Lab Top Computer to communicate with you. You should respond to this e-mail if you are interested in carrying out this assignment on my behalf.
 God be with you.

This letter must come to you as a big surprise
 but I believe it is only a day that people meet and become great friends and business partners.
 good faith
 believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you.
 I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On November 6
 2000
 an Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the
 CHEVRON PETROLEUM CORPORATION
 MR. KHALIL AL NASSER made a (Fixed deposit) for 36 calendar months
 valued at
 US$17
500
000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my bank and I happen to be his account officer before I was
 moved to my present position recently. Upon maturity in 2003
 as his account officer and as well the bank manger
 it is my duty to notify him on
 the maturity date so I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but the letter was returned undelivered.
 After sometime
 I tried sending back the letter
 but it was again returned and finally I discovered from his contract employers
 Chevron Petroleum
 Corporation that Mr. Khalil Al Nasser died as a result of torture in the hand of Saddam Hussein (former Iraqi President) during one of his trips to
 his country Iraq
 as he was accused of leaking information to the Americans.
 On further investigation
 I discovered that Mr. Al Nasser’s family wife and two sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he
 did not declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents
 including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did not leave any
 WILL. This sum of US$17
500
000.00 have been floating and placed under dormant/unserviceable account by my bank management since no
 one have heard from the owner since 2003. I wish to let you know that all the investigation I have made so far
 my bank management is not

 By end of this year
 the government will pass a new financial control law which will give the government authority to interrogate account owners of
 immediately
 by end of the year the government will definitely confiscate the money
 because my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain
 the source of the money.
 I cannot directly transfer out this money without the help of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance. As the Account Officer to
 late Al Nasser
 coupled with my present position and status in the bank as Head of Retail Banking Group
 I have the power to influence the release of
 the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account
 with the correct information concerning the account
 which I shall give you.
 All documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully worked out and there is practically no risk involved
 the transaction will be executed under 
 a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law
 beside U. A. E is porous and anything goes.
 interested
 contact me as soon as you receive this message so we can go over the details. Thanking you in advance and may God bless you.
 Please
 treat with utmost confidentiality. I shall send you copy of the deposit certificate issued to Al Nasser when the deposit was made for your perusal.
 I wait your urgent reply through my private email address: drateeq299@yahoo.com.au

 You can find the story on this website:http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2269238.stm
 "On 19th of September 2002
a group of so called rebels took over the city of Bouake to over-throw the Government of Mr.Laurent Gbagbo the President of Cote dIvoire. On the 20th day morning at about 4:18am some fractions of the same group of rebels break into our house and killed our security guard and pass-through the gate entrance to the main building and took my father away to an un-known destination."
 After about four hours later we found him (my father) at the road side
 by then he had been totally beaten and was bleeding to death lying in the pool of his own blood. From there
 we rushed him to a near by hospital and hours later he sent for my mother. So he told her that he can not make it from the doctors diagnosis
 he also told her that it was because he (my father) was not from the northern part of the country that he has been treated this way and also being a political activist. And again he said he is suspecting some of his business partners for conspiracy and this sort of brutality. He also told my mother that he deposited a huge amount of money i.e US$ 10.5million dollars(Ten million five hundred thousand us dollars only) into a Bank in the Capital city of Dakar Senegal he also told my mother where he kept the whole documents concerning this deposit that is made for investment purpose in the western world.
 That same day
 he (my father) gave up the ghost. Then with the help of the French soldiers
 we escaped to Senegal
 where we are now. I am now contacting you believing you are honest and trustworthy to help us to receive the money in your account for investment
 I and my mother has decided in compensating you 30%of the total amount for your assistance .

 Dear Sir

 I am aware that this letter will come to you as somewhat of a surprise
 but I apologize to you if I have encroached in your privacy.
 My name is Mr. Jonathan Masin (from Harare
 Zimbabwe) and I got your address through the Bloemfontein refuge camp information centre. I am the first son of late Dr Joel Masin
 a farmer and business man who died in September 2003 as a result of the land dispute in my country
 Zimbabwe.
 My father used to be a very good friend of Mr. Robert Mugabe until the government introduced the land use decree which enforced the seizure of all white owned farms. Due to my fathers
 and other eminent persons opposition to the land use act which was well pronounced all over the world
 even up to date
 Mr. Mugabe became my fathers worst enemy
 he seized his farm and imprisoned him for a long time.
 After the legal institution of my country found my father not guilty and he was released
 Mr. Mugabe used his powers as the president and plotted the assassination of my father in his farm. He was burnt to ashes and his remain were thrown into the bore hole in his farm.
 We discovered this and wrote several petitions against the government. Knowing that this petition has reached a very heated stage
 Mr Mugabe decided to eliminate my entire family. My sister and brother were kidnapped from their school and until today
 they have not been found. I ran to South Africa with my sick mother and two other younger ones and came to this refugee camp
 where we have been since December 2003.
 Why I am writing you are that
 when my father was alive
 he took me to South Africa and we visited a security company where he lodged a consignment which he informed me was loaded with the sum of US$20
500
000 (TWENTY MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS). This money was
 gotten from the sale of several of his farm machinery in combination with that of a few of his white friends whose family could not finally make it out of Zimbabwe (they were all killed secretly).They had to sell off their machinery to avoid seizure and also to ensure that they do not loose all they acquired in life.
 My request here is to seek your assistance to retrieve this consignment from the security company. As a refugee
 I can do nothing about it and to lay claim to it will be a big problem for my family
 since Mr. Mugabe is still in power. We have contacted a financial adviser who has agreed to process the necessary legal documents to assist you claim this consignment as your own. The security company does not know the contents as it was deposited by my father as diplomatic valuables.
 Our intention is to ensure that this money gets into a bank and as refugees we cannot operate bank accounts. We shall offer you 20% of the total amount for all your efforts and there is no single risk what so ever involved. If you are willing and kind enough to assist us
 please contact us on above email
 fax number. The fax number is a direct one and we use it personally through the financial adviser.
 I hope seriously that you consider this as ways to assist us get out of the mess we are in. Thank you as i wait for
 your urgent reply.

 I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan
 they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence
 I do not trust them anymore
 as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Ten Million Seven Hundred Thousand American dollars (U.S.$10.700
000) that I have with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will
 want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations. I have set
 aside only 20 % for you and for your time and also 5% as miscellaneous expenses. Reply me at your earliest convenience for more directives to my private email address: mr4rezaabdulla@walla.com
 God be with you.

 "My father was the famous  politician who stood firm against President Mugabe s idea of continuous   seizure of White  farms and the distribution of it to the blacks  without  compensation to the owners."
 "Because of my fathers  stand in this issue
 he was killed on the  by a planned motor accident along  Mashonaland  in Western Mashona   province of Zimbabwe
 the planners of the accident are said to be dissidents soldiers  suspected to have the backing of the government and President  Mugabe."
 Sir
 when this accident occurred at about 6;45 pm Zimbabwean time my father  did not die on the spot rather he was rushed to Harare hospital by some  members of the opposition group.
 Sensing that if my father die we shall be the next target
 my mother in her sick condition managed under special arrangements by some UDM members(the opposition group) managed to sneak us out of Zimbabwe to DAKAR SENEGAL
 mother confided in me  that my father
 before he died
 had released certain documents to her.
 One  of these documents is the main reason i am writing
 this letter to you
 and it  concerns a deposit of one diplomatic box my father concealed with one of the
 private security company here in dakar containing US$3M (Three million

 united states dollars) declared as  family valuables
 and other vital documents which was meant for his  political campaign in the past election march 2002.
 We are now in DAKAR SENEGAL with the original documents of
 deposit intact
 there is no way we can comfortably
 transfer this money abroad for  safe keeping and investment without assistance from someone overseas
 I  decided to write to you seek for your help for this money to be transferred  to your position for you to stand as our foreign partner and establish contact with the finance company to retrive the consignment out of the custody of the security and finance company.

 My name is Mr.Ben Otutu. and I work in the International operation
 department in a Local Bank here in South Africa. On a routine inspection I discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a BAL. Of 36
000
000 (Thirty Six Million USD) on further discreet investigation
 I also discovered that the account holder has long since passed away (dead) leaving no beneficiary to the account. The bank will approve this money to any foreigner because the former operator of the a/c is a foreigner and I am certainly sure that he is dead
 and nobody will come again for the claim of this money A foreigner can only claim this money with legal claims to the account Holder; therefore I need your cooperation in this transaction. I will provide the necessary information needed in order to claim this money
 But you will need to open an account where this can be transferred.
 If interested send your private Telephone No. And Fax number including full details of the account to be used for the Deposit I wish for utmost confidentiality in handling this transaction as my job and the future of my family would be jeopardized if it were breached.
 I want to assure you that the transaction is without risk if due process is followed accordingly. Finally I will give you 25% for your corporation. I look forward to a favorable response from you.
 "Thanks for your maxinium co-operation and remain blessed."

 Our duties include evaluation
 vetting approvals for payment for contract executed for and on behalf of my country by foreign firms
 by virtue of our position in Government
 we were able to procure this amount by means of over invoicing series of contracts that were awarded out to a conglomerate of foreign firms for the construction of Silicon mines and smelter complex. These contracts were with intent over invoiced to the tune of US$35
500
000.00(Thirty five Million five hundred United States Dollars) to enable my committee benefit from the projects.  This over invoiced amount has been tied to a particular aspect of the contract that has been satisfactorily executed and inspected as the firms are presently securing payment from my Ministry
 where our Board is in-charge of all foreign contract payment approval and recommendation to the paying bank.  
 As a civil servant still in active government service
 We are forbidden by law to operate an account outside the shores of Namibia. Hence this message to you seeking your assistance so as to enable me present your private/company account details as a beneficiary of contractual claims alongside that of the other contractors
 to enable us transfer the difference of US$35
500
000.00 (Thirty Five Million
 Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) into an account that will be nominated by you. 
 On actualization
 the fund will be disbursed as stated below:
 1.\t20% to be allocated to you

 Well I shall be extremely happy if you will kindly understand the content of my proposal thereby contributing your own quarter.

 Well I am Mr Cyril J Garang 
 and an indigene of G/Bissau
 though I left my country as a matter of death scallating because of wars but that was not my primary aim of leaving my country to Dakar Senegal where I am currently staying now
 my major reason is because I was humiliated by my late father’s relatives as a result of their much focus on material things. I left my country because I was the only child left in my late father’s linage and It will not come to an end rather I will ensure I keep the family name on constant remembrance and existing.
 But the principal aim for my being here is to concentrate well on what I will do in future with the money my late father left in one of the banks in Europe
 the money is Five million eight hunderd thousand US dollars ( $5.8 M).This money was meant for his multi investment projects before death struck him down. This is the principal reason why I am here in this country so that I shall concentrate and be mindful to this everlasting opportunity I inherited and to search for one who will stand on my behalf in the claim.
 My contacting you is based on your complete capability to move to the Europe bank as soon as you could so that you will have a Table discussion with the bank thereby reclaiming and retransferring this money to your own bank account where it will be confidently be secured for my future investment .
 There are other things that we should discuss as soon as you write back because we need to round up every bit of this matter before all the bank details should be exchanged to enable us come to close end of the whole matter which will lift me up from here to your country with your help and where we should stay for our investment projects as we agreed in the next page. Don’t forget that there are some hidden percentage that I have wholeheartedly mapped for you which will be revealed when we come to agreement that you will help me to secure this money in your own easy accessible bank account.
 Hope to hear from you and it will sound better and encouraging if you will reply with your complete data’s so that I shall commence all applications on the need able documents that will ease the direct recommendation and also empowering you as my foreign live partner or my late father’s business associate before his death.
 Regards:
 Mr Cyril J Garang.

  I feel quite safe dealing with you in this important business. Though
 this medium (Internet) has been greatly abused
 I choose to reach you through it because it still remains the fastest medium of communication. However
 this correspondence is unofficial and private
 and it should be treated as such.
   At first I will like to assure you that this transaction is 100% risk and trouble free to both parties.
   My name is MODISE ROBERT
 I work as the operational manager in account management section in charge of credit and foreign bills of one of a prime banks here in South Africa. On\xa0 a\xa0 routine\xa0 inspection I Discovered\xa0 a\xa0 dormant\xa0 domiciliary\xa0 account\xa0 with\xa0 a Balance of\xa0 US$168
559
000. 00 (One hundred and sixty eight million
  five hundred and fifty nine thousand U.S dollars only}. The account holder[The deceased] was believed to be incharge of Former Iraq resident
Saddam Hussein secret CRUDE OIL transactions in Africa before his\xa0 death. On further discreet investigation
 I also discovered that the account holder has died long ago with his family on a fatal Auto- Accident leaving no beneficiary to the account and no other person knows about this account.
   I am in close contact with the manager of the bank here who is my partner and he is willing to approve the transfer to any reliable and trustworthy foreigner with foreign bank account because the former operator of the a/c is a foreigner. I am certainly sure that he has no writen or oral WILL attached to the account 
no beneficiary and\xa0 nobody will come again for the claim of this money. It is only a foreigner who can claim this money with legal claims to the account holder which I will provide to you if you are
  interested
 therefore I need your cooperation in this transaction. This money will remain useless in this dormant account if I did not transfer the fund out to a foreign account.
   I will provide the necessary information and documents needed in order to claim this money. I only need your cooperation as a foreigner to provide your safe bank account information for the transfer. All arrangement that will ensure a smooth transfer of the fund to the account which you are to nominate is already in place.You should provide me with your correct account information for the transfer and your direct cell phone lines for easy communication. I wish for utmost confidentiality in handling this transaction. 
 At the conclussion of this transaction
 your share will be 15% of the\xa0 total transfer sum
 80% for me and my partner while 5% will be set aside for any expenses both parties might incure during the process of the transfer. The fund will be transferred to your
  account in two parts. I will first transfer USD 38 Million to your account as a test\xa0 transfer. I will fly over to meet you after the successful transfer for sharing according to the agreed percentages. I will have the remaining balance of USD130
559 Million transferred to your account\xa0 only after the successful sharing of the first transfer without any disappointment from your side.
 Let me hear from you urgently by Emailing me.

 My name is Mr. Fredrick Andrew. I trained and work as an external auditor for the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS) of Singapore. I have taken pains to find your contact through personal endeavours because a late investor 
 who bears the same last name with you has left monies totaling a little over $10 million United States Dollars with Our Bank for the past twelve years and no next of kin has come forward all these years.
 Banking regulation legislation in Singapore demand that I notify the fiscal authorities after a statutory time period of twelve years when dormant accounts of this type are called in by the monetary regulatory bodies. The above set of facts underscores my reason of writing.I am of the settled conviction that using my insider leverage
 working with you
since you have the same last Name with the Late Investor
 we can secure the funds in the account for us instead of allowing it pass as unclaimed funds into the coffers of the Government of Singapore. This exactly is why I crave your participation and cooperation.
 I have seized all relevant information (legal and Banking) that will facilitate our putting you forward as the claimant/beneficiary of the funds and ultimately transfer the money to any account nominated by you. Be assured that I and my colleagues are on top of the situation all the time and there will be no risk .
 Needless to say
 Uttermost CONFIDENTIALITY is of vital importance if we are to successfully reap the immense benefits of this transaction. I have intentionally left out the finer details for now until I hear from you. To affirm your willingness and cooperation to my proposal please do so by email
 stating your full names
 date of birth
 telephone number and fax number. I do expect your prompt response.
 pls do contact me in my email address[fredr_andrew@yahoo.com.sg].
 Waiting to hear from you soon.
 Thank you.

 Dear Sir

 We are making this contact with you because of the reliable information available to us concerning your reputation and that of your company. This business request may seem strange
 but I crave your indulgence and pray you
 view it seriously as we re convinced that you would be capable to provide us with a solution to a moneytransfer of Thirty Two Million
 Five hundred thousand United State Dollars (US$32
500
000.00) First of all I am an accountant and Auditor of the Petroleum (special) Trust Fund (N.N.P.C) the Apex Department of the Oil Industry in Nigeria.
 I am also a member of its Foreign Contract Tenders Committee (FCTC). My principal job/function has to do with the Appraisal and Approval of payment of contract awarded by this parastatal. In the course of my duties
 I discovered various over inflated contract values totaling US$32.5Million. The said amount emanated from deliberate over invoicing of old projects executed by some foreign firms through some government officials.These officials have since been moved or retired following the inauguration of the new administration. After due consultation with key members of the Tenders Committee (FCTC)
 I was mandated to seek and arrange with a trusted foreign National who can assist us in transferring the above state amount out of Nigeria.Now that all the contracts have been paid following the completion and commissioning of the various contract
 the above mentioned sum through approved is still floating. We decided to transfer this money to a safe and trusted bank accounts with !
  a very reliable person to assist us after which the funds be share in the understated ratio.Your assistance is needed for two main reasons;
 \xa0(i) As government employees 
we are not permitted by the Nigeria law to operateforeignaccounts. (ii)Since the initial contracts were executed by the 
 foreign firms
 only a foreign firm can make claims or as a beneficiary for the purpose of transferring the money out of Nigeria.We have unanimously agreed to compensate you with 35% of the total sum ( US$32.5Million ) if you are willing to render us your assistance as regards the transfer. It was also agreed that 5% shall be set aside to offset incidental expenses that might be incurred by either of us course of offsetting this transfer. The remaining 60% shall be our due share.All necessary arrangements required for a speedy conclusion of this transaction have been put in place with top officials of the Nigeria Federal Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Nigeria to enable us conclude the 
 whole transaction within a very shortspace of time.What is required of you is 
 first to furnish us with the following through my email address.
 3.)Your private / official telephone and fax number.While promising you a 
 smooth and hitch -free transfer of this fund into the account nominated by you
 we want you to know that this is very sensitive transaction which should not be disclosed to any other party. This is very important because this deals involves some high ranking Nigeria 
 Government Officials who would not want to be involved in any form of scandal.We however trust that this will be the beginning of a lasting business relationship between you and us as we shall appreciate your advice on the investment opportunities in your line of business or any other type of viable business in your country.If this deal interest you
reply me 
 immediately through my personal E-mail: uzoromaobi@o2.pl or call me on my

I am Mr. Michael Frein
 I work with a finance company here in the United Kingdom.Our company is a frontline finance house with clients all over the World. We are an independent financial institution with most secure operation in keeping financial deposits from any sort of fraud
 theft or laundering investigation. Our regulated position has attracted all manner of clientele to our organisation including heads of various governments
 top-level executives
etc.
 One of our clients
 DR. ROBERT DIMITRIS
 who was before his death
 was an adviser to the Organisation of Petroleum Export Country (OPEC)
 had over fifty Million pounds lodged with us. On his death five years ago
 his heir (his wife) put a claim for his money and my company paid off in line with her request. However
his wife did not know that the facts of Nine million
 eight hundred thousand British Pounds (GBP3.8 Million)paid in by DR.ROBERT DIMITRIS in a different account and the money is still lying with us.
 I therefore made further investigations and discovered that DR. ROBERT DIMITRIS did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents
 including his Bank deposit paperwork in my Financial Institution.This sum of GBP3.8 million is still in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one has and will ever come forward to claim it. According to British law
 at the expiration of 7 (seven) years
 the money will revert to the ownership of the British Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Based on my position in this company
 I have kept the facts of this case and a few others I am
 still watching closely to myself alone.The reason I have decided to contact you is because I am quite certain I can move these funds out immediately but would need your assistance.
 What this requires is that you put in an application with a letter of probate
 which I will forward to you. This will enable us to open a premium account with my Financial Institution and I will simply make an internal database transfer of the Funds to your account. Once this is done and you will see your new balance
 you will put in a claim to have your money.However
 due to the fact that my company would not entertain your request to open an account without a proof of the fund origin

 I have without divulging secured the copy of the deposit document of the said fund and will forward it to you when I have your interest in my proposal. On grounds that you agree to do this with me
 the money will be shared in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. However
 it is quite necessary that these are kept as confidential as possible for its successive completion within days. Please contact me and I will take it from there. Once I hear from you
I will give you access to view DR.ROBERT DIMITRIS account details and you can check
 his account statement via the bank s online services to certify what am saying.
 Please reply through my email address or I will be expecting your reply.
 Sincerely

 Mr. Michael

I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On November 6
 2000
 an Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the CHEVRON PETROLEUM CORPORATION
 MR. KHALIL AL NASSER made a (Fixed deposit) for 36 calendar months
 valued at US$17
500
000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my bank and I happen to be his account officer before I was moved to my present position recently. Upon maturity in 2003
 as his account officer and as well the bank manger
 it is my duty to notify him on the maturity date so I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but the letter was returned undelivered.
 After sometime
 I tried sending back the letter
 but it was again returned and finally I discovered from his contract employers
 Chevron Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Khalil Al Nasser died as a result of torture in the hand of Saddam Hussein (former Iraqi President) during one of his trips to his country Iraq
 as he was accused of leaking information to the Americans. On further investigation
 I discovered that Mr. Al Nasser? family wife and two sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he did not declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents
 including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did not leave any WILL.
 This sum of US$17
500
000.00 have been floating and placed under dormant/ unserviceable account by my bank management since no one have heard from the owner since 2003. I wish to let you know that all the investigation I have made so far
 my bank management is not aware of it
 I am the only one that have the information.
  With the recent change of government in my country and with their efforts to support the United Nations in checkmating terrorism aid in the U. A. E. By end of this year
 the government will pass a new financial control law which will give the government authority to interrogate account owners of above $5
000
000.00 to explain the source of the funds
 making sure it is not for terrorism support. If I do not move this money out of the country immediately
 by end of the year the government will definitely confiscate the money
 because my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain the source of the money.
  I cannot directly transfer out this money without the help of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance. As the Account Officer to late Al Nasser
 coupled with my present position and status in the bank as Head of Retail Banking Group
 I have the power to influence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account
 with the correct information concerning the account
 which I shall give you. All documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully worked out and there is practically no risk involved
 the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law
 beside U. A. E is porous and anything goes.
  If you accept to work with me
 I want you to state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage
 so that both parties will be satisfied. If you are interested
 contact me as soon as you receive this message so we can go over the details. Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. Please
 treat with utmost confidentiality.
  I shall send you copy of the deposit certificate issued to Al Nasser when the deposit was made for your perusal. I wait your urgent reply through my private email address: ateeq_khan001@yahoo.com

 Mr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN</p>

I wish to present this proposal for the purpose of investment in your country. My name is Patrick Gabo
 the only child of Hon.Ferz Uotr Gabo the former Minister of Transport and Communication with the present Government of President Kabbah of Sierra-Leone.
 "My father and mother were arrested on 1st of Nov 2001 by Kabbahs Government on allegation of using their postion in the govenment to aid smuggling of diamond from the Kono diamond field
it was just a political vendetta."
 My father later died in the prison
it was diagnonised that he was poisoned
 but Government report says heart failure. Whatever it is
 let God be the judge. He sent a note to me before his death
 regarding a deposit of the sum of USD$8
000.000.00) Eight Million United States Dollars in a Finanice Firm in DAKAR SENEGAL.
 He instructed Me to move immediately with the documents to a neighbouring country to seek asylum. I moved to the Republic of Mali where I spent some time before finally moving to DAKAR
to enquire about deposit.
 My mother died just on Sept.26th
 so i am kind of desolete.Meanwhile i have located the Finanice Firm
 and have also discussed the possible transfer of the fund to road.
 I have to introduce a trusted foreign partner who would be my trustee and investor
 since the management of the Firm adviced that I should solicit for an individual or corporate organization to claim the deposit for me as they cannot release it directly to me due to my refugee status in Senegal. hence the need for your assistance.
 I request that you be my trustee and assist me in effecting the transfer of the fund to your account or an account you will nominate. You will also be resposible for the investment and management of the fund untill i am able to join you after my education in your country. You and Me will agree on a percentage you will take for your assistance.
 Please let me know immediately if you can assist me so that I will give you more informations about the deposit.
 Looking forward to your candid and urgent and positive reply today on my Private Email: Adresse;(emailgabo@voila.fr).
 I thank you in anticipation to your quick response.
 YOURS FAITHFULLY

 Patrick Gabo.

I want to solicit with you for assistance in regards to a financial
 Zimbabwe that was murdered for land dispute in my country. Before the death
 family valuables
 when he realized the looming dangers in Zimbabwe.
 This amountwas meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals for
 the farms and also for the establishment of new farms in Swaziland.This land
 dispute started when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land
 reform
which was particularly targeted at the rich white farmers and a few
 black farmers (my father included).This resulted in the gruesome killing of
 rich farmers (mainly whites) and the unlawful possession of their properties
 "by Mugabes war veterans
 under the  disguise of fighting for the interest"
 of the country. It is against this background that I fled the country with
 my family
to the United Kingdom where we are currently seeking asylum.I have
 been adviced to seek foreign assistance
 as the United Kingdom law prohibits
 asylum seekers from operating bank accounts or involve in financial
 trustworthiness to be able to entrust the above said amount and help me
 "with investment opportunities. My familys survival depends on this money"
 There are two options
 firstly
 you can choose to accept a negotiable
 percentage of the total amount for your assistance or go into partnership
 for the proper investment of the money in your country.
 We shall discuss in detail the modalities involved when I hear from you.
 I await your reply through my confidential email media
 while I implore you
 to maintain the absolute secrecy required to ensure a safe and hitch free
 transaction.
 I shall furnish you with more details on request.
 Yours truly

 My Dear Friend

 Compliments of the season.I did like to send to you the best wishes of good health and success in your pursuits particularly through my proposal as contained in this letter. I may not wish to disclose how I got your email address for now. After due deliberation with my son
I decided to forward to you this business proposal
 we want you to assist us .I will give you more information. As to this regard as soon as you reply.
 I therefore personally appeal to you seriously and religiously for your urgent assistance to move this money in to your country where I believe it will be safe since I cannot leave the country due to the restriction of movement imposed on the members of my family by the Senegal Government.
 This money came as a result of a payback contract deal between my husband and a Russian firm in our country.The Russian partners returned my husbands share .Presently
 the Government has intensified their probe in to my husbands financial resources which has led to the freezing of all our accounts
 local and foreign
 the revoking of all our business licences and the arrest of my First son.
 In view of this I want to acted very fast to withdraw this money from one of our finance houses before it will be closed down.My husband deposited the money in a finance firm for safe keeping . No record is known about this fund by the government because there is no documentation showing that we have such funds.
 "Further more
 my elder son have been in detention in the last four years following the death of my late husband for charges of State organized murder and corrupt practices. he was just been released by the Supreme Court after the president brokered a deal with my family regarding his freedom. and he is still under interrogation about my late husbands assets and some vital documents."
 Due to the current situation in the country and government attitude to my family
I cannot make use of this money within
 thus I seek your help in transferring this funds out for investment than leaving the fund here and to invest the money to profit my family Bearing in mind that you may assist me.l have decided to part with 25% of the total sum.
 I am seriously considering to settle down abroad in a friendly atmosphere like yours as soon as this fund get into your account so that I can start all over again if only you wish. I shall ask my son Mustapha to come over to your country to liaise with you. If this proposal satisfies you. please do not let me out to the security as I am giving you this information
 in total trust and confidence.
 Please kindly reply by return mail and please include your personal telephone and fax numbers. Conclusively
we have decided part with 25% of the total sum. of the total sum
10% will be for expenses incurred during thecause of this transaction
 while 65% is to be held on trust by you until we can decide on a suitable business investment in your country subsequent to our free movement by the Senegal Government.
 I will greatly appreciate if you accept my proposal in good faith.
 Your URGENT response is needed.
 Regards and God Bless you.

Dear.md
        It is my pleasure to write this mail to you and to say thanks for your effort in providing an opportunity to read my mail. I got your contact when i was making some searches in the internet.
 My name is Mrs chrrey Mohameed
 a Liberian. I was until recently the wife of Mr. Ibrahim Mohameed  who was the chief army officer to my country Libera. I am contacting you  to seek your co-operation in investing $USD10.M in your company or your country
s economy.
 My  husband made this money when he was on sit as the commander and chief army officer while  Charles Taylor is the president  of Liberia.
 Due to some religious and political problems 
 my husband was  hijacked and brutally assasainated by the rebel leathers in Liberia.
 "It is worthy to note that during my husbands life time he used his position as a former chief aid to must have made this money in question."
 "This money was realised from  the sales of gold and diamond 
which are the countrys major resources and sources of income.And before his death 
my husband was able to send this money via a Ghanian diplomatic contact to the country 
where it is currently secured with a security company as a FAMILY  TREASURE"
  and  my name was used as the depositor in view of my husband
s position as an insider in the government.
 And it was my husband
s refusal to realise the money to former President Charles Taylor that resulted in the killing in February 2003.
 Now 
 that i have passed through the mourning ordeal for my husband  I am   thinking and planning the next step to take with respect to how  and where  to invest the money.
 "So my aim of sending this mail to you is to solicit your assistance in transfering this money to your country where it could be invested in a viable business for our mutual benefit. I am ready to enter into a joint venture with your company or we can open a new company with the money because im sure the money inside the box can establish a company of any type."
 I want to assure you that you will be highly rewarded for your assistance both in cash or in the joint venture.
 Please reply to this mail
 indicating your ability to handle this transaction so that i will give you details to enable us map out strategies for the implementation of this project.
 Best regards

 Mrs Chrrey mohameed

This is not a get rich quick scheme
 but with a little effort will make a nice little return - perhaps pay off that credit card after the Xmas spend
 or pay for that much needed holiday
 Please take the time to read the following information
 which I received recently.
 Please try not to be sceptical about this program and at least think about it for a few days
 otherwise you could be throwing away over �
000 in cash! This system has worked for 2 years and the thousands of people
 who joined
 have been amazed by the results of giving a little time and just �00 (�5/$5.00).
 "The business plan I am about to share with you works perfectly every single time. Ive never made less than �
000 from it on each occasion. Let me assure you that this is a LEGITIMATE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
 a perfectly legal moneymaking enterprise. It does not require you to sell anything. It does not require you to speak to your friends
 family or anybody else (unless you want to). "
 "This must sound like an outrageous claim
 particularly if youve never had possession of this sort of money before
 but believe me
 this business works like nothing else you may have seen before in your life! By following the simple 3-step plan set out below
 within a few short weeks your life could be transformed beyond all recognition! "
 Please do not allow your initial scepticism to deprive you of financial success. 
 "This program is by no means new. It has been in existence in many forms for at least a decade. But in the early days
 it required a lot more time and effort
 as well as an outlay of a few hundred pounds. However
 thanks to PayPal and the Internet
 the outlay is now virtually ZERO! And whats more
 the entire process is FASTER
 EASIER
 and MORE LUCRATIVE than it has EVER been! "
 "This program works no matter what country you are in
 or what currency you use. It doesnt matter how old or how young you are. And you certainly wont need any special knowledge or talent. You wont need to run a website
 or make phone calls
 or make photocopies
 or send out letters through the mail
 or pay for advertising
 etc. "
 You will need:
 �\tAn email address 
 �\tA Premier or Business PayPal account with at least �(�5/$5) deposited in it 
 �\t30 minutes of your time 
 PayPal is the simplest method of sending and receiving payments online that anyone has ever seen! Once you have a PayPal account
 you can send and receive credit card payments to or from anyone - anywhere in the world! However
 please read further before you visit their website. 
 To get started
 follow the instructions exactly as set out below and then prepare yourself for an influx of cash over the next 30 days! 
 STEP 2: When you have opened your account
 send a �(�5/$5) payment from your PayPal account to the FIRST email address in the list below
 along with a note saying: 
 1.\thurst_l@lineone.net
 2.\tadmin@makinscentz.com
 3.\ttracy@chezmoi79.freeserve.co.uk
 4.\tcharlotte2012@hotmail.co.uk
 5.\tkingsley.enterprise@tiscali.co.uk
 STEP 3: Once you\ve sent a �(�5/$5) payment to the address at the top of the list (along with your note - this is VERY important!)
 the next thing to do is copy the contents of this page
 as you\ll be sending it out (as an email message) to at least 40 people
 although with the legitimate mailing lists and the different ways of advertising on the internet
 e.g. Ebay
 the amount of recipients of your mail could well exceed into the hundreds
 thousands or even millions if you wish. The more people who join in
 the more profitable for everyone on the list. If you are going to use a mailing list
 please make sure it is from a reputable source and includes people who have "Opted In". These lists contain names of people who have no objections to receiving these types of mails. 
 "The e-mail that you will send out will contain a copy of this document in your new email message. (You can edit and format the message text in any way you want! However
 its best to just leave the text as it is because you want your email to be read by everyone who receives it)."
 "A word of warning! Dont be tempted to add your email address to position 1 in order to earn money fast! It doesnt work like that! If you do that
 you will ONLY reach the people you directly send emails to
 and then your address will be immediately removed from the No 1 place and you wont reach any more people! However
 if you add your name to the No 5 position
 there will be literally tens of thousands of people receiving and sending e-mails later - when your name has reached the No 1spot!!! "
 When you send out your e-mails
 your address will initially be at No 5 in the list. The response-rate for this program is much higher than any typical email marketing campaign for a number of reasons
 which are explained later. 
 "As long as you send your e-mails to people who are likely to be interested in this program
 you can expect an average response from about 25% of the people you send to. Lets be conservative here and assume that you receive only an average response rate of 12.5%. "
 So
 when your name starts to hit the No 1 position within the next few days
 it will be YOUR turn to collect the money! Over the course of 30 days the money will be sent to you
 by a few thousand people just like yourself. The first payments will arrive within a few days
 and they will continue at the rate of about 100 payments per day for about 30 days. After that time
 the volume of payments begins to taper off as your e-mail address vacates the No 1 position.

Dear.md
        It is my pleasure to write this mail to you and to say thanks for your effort in providing an opportunity to read my mail. I got your contact when i was making some searches in the internet.
 My name is Mrs chrrey Mohameed
 a Liberian. I was until recently the wife of Mr. Ibrahim Mohameed  who was the chief army officer to my country Libera. I am contacting you  to seek your co-operation in investing $USD10.M in your company or your country
s economy.
 My  husband made this money when he was on sit as the commander and chief army officer while  Charles Taylor is the president  of Liberia.
 Due to some religious and political problems 
 my husband was  hijacked and brutally assasainated by the rebel leathers in Liberia.
 "It is worthy to note that during my husbands life time he used his position as a former chief aid to must have made this money in question."
 "This money was realised from  the sales of gold and diamond 
which are the countrys major resources and sources of income.And before his death 
my husband was able to send this money via a Ghanian diplomatic contact to the country 
where it is currently secured with a security company as a FAMILY  TREASURE"
  and  my name was used as the depositor in view of my husband
s position as an insider in the government.
 And it was my husband
s refusal to realise the money to former President Charles Taylor that resulted in the killing in February 2003.
 Now 
 that i have passed through the mourning ordeal for my husband  I am   thinking and planning the next step to take with respect to how  and where  to invest the money.
 "So my aim of sending this mail to you is to solicit your assistance in transfering this money to your country where it could be invested in a viable business for our mutual benefit. I am ready to enter into a joint venture with your company or we can open a new company with the money because im sure the money inside the box can establish a company of any type."
 I want to assure you that you will be highly rewarded for your assistance both in cash or in the joint venture.
 Please reply to this mail
 indicating your ability to handle this transaction so that i will give you details to enable us map out strategies for the implementation of this project.
 Best regards

 Yours faithfully


Please I know that this letter may come to you as a surprise based on the fact that I have not had any previous contact with you.
 Briefly
 I am master Nelson Williams
 son of the late Mr.Richard Williams
 former director of Sierre Leone Gold and Diamond Corporation who was  murdered by assailants .
 Shortly before this unfortunate incident
 my father had informed me about an important contract he had executed (supply of Gold and diamond Mining Equipments)where he realized this fund ($15.5m)fifteen million five hundred thousand dollars and later when he heard the rumor of war in my country Sierra Leone he move the fund to Ghana where he deposited it.
 He showed me some lodgment documents with which he had deposited the money encased in a trunk box with a security /safe deposit company here in Accra Ghana
 He informed me in confidence that the security company is not aware of the exact contents of the box 
 rather he had told them that it contained African artworks
 that he had assembled for his overseas partner who would soon be coming to claim them for exportation. As a result of this explanation
 the box was accepted for safe-keeping by the security company without  inspection.
 When the political situation in Freetown
 Sierra Leone worsened
 I escaped into Accra 
 Ghana and had since contacted the security company
 identified  myself properly and informed them about the sad fate my father had suffered. I presented the lodgment
 documents and they confirmed that they have the trunk  box in their vault.
 So I informed them that I intend initiating contacts with my fathers overseas partner who owns the consignment so that he can come and take delivery of it.
 My decision to retrieve this box
 transfer the money and start a new life forms
 the basis of this enquiry from you.
 1) Could you assist me with the logistics and a good personal/company bank account through which I can retrieve the consignment out he security company
 and transfer this money out of Ghana ?
 2) Could you advise me on a good business proposition into which I can invest this money so that it would yield good dividends
 3) Could you assist me obtain resident papers in your country so that I can continue my education there from where I stopped.
 I sincerely will agree to any suitable percentage you may request for your assistance to me.
 I shall prefer most of our communication to be done via phone. I need not inform you that this matter is strictly confidential. I want you to treat it as such.
 God will surely bless you in abundance as you made up your heart to help an orphan like me.

Dear Sir/Madam

 "Thanks for finding time to go through my mail. I am Mrs. Fatima Hinga
 the wife of Lieutenant Colonel John Garang Hinga the Leader of Sudanese Peoples Liberation Govement (SPLM) one of the leading political parties in Sudan which was formed in 1983. He died during the out brake of the recent civil war in Sudan. Before his death
 he held many important offices which includes being the prime minister in a coalition government between 1986 to 1989."
 He also was the leader of the Umma Party a strong political organization in Sudan. After his tenure as coalition prime minister
 he was made to be in-charge of the payment of Sudanese Media communications department in 2001. My husband was killed by a group known as Sadiq al Mahdi at the on set of the civil war while fighting for the liberation of the Sudanese people from the hands of a dictatorship government.
 I am 51 years old now and seriously ill although I am now receiving treatment in a hospital here in Thailand. During the period of our marriage we were blessed with a male child by name Musa Hinga who is also here taking care of me. After the death of my husband
 I inherited a huge amount of money (25million US dollars) which my late husband deposited with a Security Company in Thailand for safe keeping. I now decided to contact you to assist me and my son to claim this money from where it was deposited and probably guide us in investing the fund in a worthwhile flourishing business over there. I hereby ask for your help and assistance. Although I am a novice in business
 I have an eye on rigid properties. Your advice on other areas of private sector will be highly appreciated.
 I believe that you would be of great help in guiding my son to a successful business investment in your country even when I am gone.
 I will appreciate if you will show interest in collaborating with us
 as this transaction will benefit both of us on joint venture partnership.
 Furthermore I am ready to give you a good negotiable percentage cash reward for your assistance. Detailed information on other proceedings will be made available to you upon receiving your reply showing interest in collaborating with us as I look forward to your urgent reply.
 Sincerely Yours
 Fatima Hinga.

 Compliment Of The Season
 
 On a very good day. I am (jerry kaboreEsq)
The Head of file Department in African developent bank (ADB).I got your contact from Yahoo tourist search.
 When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your capability and reliability to champion this businees opportunity when i prayed to God or Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death
 we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines
 but unfortunately we learnt that all his 
  supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don’t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.
 The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years
 the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner
 and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner
 in respect to the provision of a foreign account
 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during
   the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague. There after i will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. 
 Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged
 you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name
 your bank account number
 your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply

Dakar - Senegal.
 Hello Dear.
 "Compliments of the season. I am Mrs. Linda johnson
 a civil servant from Zimbabwe. I got your contact from Chamber and Commerce office as I was searching for someone who will help me out of my present predicament
My late husband
 Mr.Icheke Johnson was the co-owner of an Agricultural firm and his partner happens to be among the white farmers that the dictator President of Zimbabwe
 Robert Mugabe took over their farmlands and handed over to the blacks
 despite all the pleas from the International Community
 and members of the commonwealth countrys Most of the companys assets
 animal farms and milk industry were seized and confiscated by the tyrant President."
 "My late husband was a British citizen of African descent and we both lived in the companys staff quarters but our lives were threatened by agents of President Mugabe. Since then
 my husband and I have been living in exile in Dakar - Senegal. My husband died last August as a result of cardiac arrest. A substantial amount of money was deposited in the finance house by my husband before his death through the help of the International Red Cross staff
 because President Mugabe
 placed order for the closure of the accounts of all the white farmers and no one is allowed to transfer more than ten thousand dollars abroad but luckily enough
 I and my late husband along with some other farmers were assisted through diplomatic means with the help of the International Red Cross to send our money abroad."
 The total Sum is THIRTY SIX million US dollars (US$36.000.000.)
 the money is part of our savings and what my husband inherited from his late father
 from whom we took over the family business. The money arrived safely in Europe. All the documents to the deposition of the money are with me here in Senegal and with the Bank also for Security reasons. I would like you to assist me to relocate the money to your country into any account of your choice or keep it for me in your safe custody until I am able to come to your country after my operation soon. I would like to invest the money into any lucrative business
 you deem profitable and your assistance is highly needed in the areas of investment feasibility studies.
 "Hence I need your cooperation to secure this deposit which is as it stands now
 the only hope of my survival as I have already lost my husband
 coupled with my sickness and the situation of insecurity. Life is no more the same with me after all the lot I have gone through. Moreover
 I wouldnt mind paying you any amount you will charge me up to 20% of the total money for your assistance in relocating and keeping the money for me as well as helping me to carry out proper investment. You keep 80% for me pending execution of the investment."
 As a sick person
 it will be difficult to handle this alone
 hence I need your immense help
 coupled with your distinguished business acumen and track record. Please
 I would like you to come to my assistance
 I am a lonely widow and in utter confusion and distress.
 This business is solely between two of us and should there be any need for a third party
 I will contact one of the Red Cross staff with whom I have established some trust. I am scared that if any one gets to know about this
 he might take advantage of my helpless situation. to diverted this fund or seat on the money without helping me to manage it as planed
 so please if your willing to help kindly contact me very urgently

 "Sincerely yours
"

I do understand the concern this letter will bring to you for the fact that it comes from someone strange to you. But be rest assured for it comes with good intentions. I decided to contact you for your help in tranfering some money out from Malaysia into your personal or company account overseas after going through your company profile.
 I am Mrs. Patricia Sithole the wife of late Mr. Sipho Sithole from Zimbabwe. My husband was among the rich black farmers murdered in cold blooded in Zimbabwe by war veterans of President Robert Mugabe. However
 the number of farmers killed in Zimbabwe over the new land act introduced by president do not give any concern. My main aim of contacting you is to assist me in transferring the sum of US$30
500
000 (Thirty million Five hundred thousand United States Dollars) into your nominated overseas account.
 This money was given to my husband by President Mugabe when they were still in good terms for investment purposes. My husband deposited this money in a security company in Malaysia
Asia as if he foresaw the looming blow of his death. My husband later deposited the said funds as family treasure in order to avoid seizure since Malaysia
 have almost the same land laws with Zimbabwe.
 Presently
 I am residing in Malaysia with the rest of my family as asylum seekers. Based on our present status we are deprived of some financial rights of banking activities. Moreover
 this money is the only thing my late husband left for us as such the entire life of my family depends on this money coupled with the responsibilities rested on me. I will be willing to go into partnership on any lucrative business you will suggest in your country.
 The sharing pattern is negotiable between you and me. I will like you to contact me through my email address (pat_mrssithole@walla.com).
 For strict confidential reason in case my proposal arouse your interest or if not
 please do keep it confidential.
 I hope to hear from you as soon as possible.
 Best regards

 Mrs. Patricia Sithole.

Dakar
 Rep.of Senegal
 West Africa.
  Dear Beloved One.
  Thank you for giving me your time;Please be patient and read my email to you
 this letter might come as a surprise to you
and you could be wondering where I got your contact.
  I got your address through a personal search on the internet for someone relaible and trustworthy
so i decided to contact you for an assistant
 which I do hope you will take your time to consider. 
  I am a widow  to the late principal accountant of Sierra Leon central bank who was assassinated due to political hostility in my country.
  For the sake of our lives
my children and i fled to a neighbouring country
 Senegal; where we are now seeking refuge.
  I must confess to you
our journey to Senegal was not a jolly ride as we encountered a lot of problems
most painful was a particular situation that left us in a state of penury and where we also lost our travelling documents
thereby making 
 it impossible for us to travel now.
  Months ago i was diagnosed with cancer
this futher made our lives more difficult as i am lacking funds to take care of my self and my children.
  I decided to contact you
seeking your assistance because i am having problems recovering a large deposit made by my late husband overseas since the company maintained that instructions left by my late husband the original depositor
states that the funds be "RELEASED TO ME HIS WIFE OR A FOREIGN REPRESENTATIVE ONLY"
 believing he would appoint someone by himself to represent him for the claim but unfortunately he died earlier.
  This is the only hope my family has of surviving
paticularly my only son
who has so much dreams and i want to do the best i can to help them fufill thier dreams.
  I am contacting you to help me make the claims by representing my husband as the foreign representative
since i cannot travel to make the claims my self due to my present condition
i am pleading with you to help us claim the funds from the security firm and most importantly
 your ability to put the said funds into circulation wisely for our joint interest and relocating my children particularly my son is a major considerable factor regarding my request as my knowledge on financial matters is not enough to handle such amount of fund(us$16
000
000.00) 
 sixteen million dollars.
  In view of this
 if you are touched to work with me in sincerity
 by standing as my late husband
s foreign representative to receive the said deposit on our behalf
 we shall embrace you as our family and will compensate you accordingly.
  I am willing to share the money 40% for you
40% for me and my children and the remaining 10% we be set aside for any expenses that may be incurred in the course of this transaction
all i really care about now is the welfare of my children.
  As you indicate interest
 please contact my son ANTA OMAR on this email address (an_omar07@yahoo.fr)or call him on his phone number Tel: 
 +221-4488469  to enable him give you further information relating to the funds and the steps we shall take to finalize on the project
i have handed this project to him as my health conditions makes it hard for me to talk or go around.
  Thanking you in advance for your kind and urgent response
 more so for keeping our proposal to your self.
 Sincerely
 Grace Omar.

 First Light Branch

 West Africa.
 ATTN:My Dear

 My name is Mr. Michael Ezra. I am the accountant of the International Commercial Bank-Ghana
 First Light Branch Accra. I am a Ghanaian married with three kids. I am writing to solicit your assistance in the noble transfer of US$14
800
000.00 (Fourtheen million
 eight hundred thousand U.S.dollars). This fund is the excess of what my branch in which I am the accountant made as profit during the last year. I have already submitted an approved end of the last year report for the year 2005 to my Head Office here in Accra and they will never know of this Excess.I have since then
 placed this amount of US$14
800
000.00 (Fourtheen million
 eight hundred thousand U.S. dollars) on a SUSPENCE ACCOUNT without a beneficiary.
 As an officer of the bank
 I cannot be directly connected to this money thus I am impelled to request for your assistance to receive this money into your bank account.
 I intend to part 30% of this fund to you while 70% shall be for me. I do need to stress that there are practically no risk involved in this. It is going to be a bank-to-bank transfer to your nominated bank account anywhere you feel safer. All I need from you is to stand as the original depositor of this fund.
 Frankly speaking I have been working in this bank for close to 10 years and I have nothing to show for it
my yearly income is barely about $3
500 USD after tax and the major reason I packaged this transaction is that I have a 9 year old daughter with leukemia and needs a bone marrow transplant or she will die. I have already made arrangement for this surgery in the UK but I could not afford it
 so I really need your help to do this deal or my daughter will die.
 I am offering you 30% of the total sum after this money is wired to your account
 because it is a simple bank-to-bank inheritance claim transfer.I will also like you to get me rest assured that you will not abandon me when the money gets to your account.I have all the payment claim information worked out. All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal Through.
 Please i will like you to answer me this questions.
 (1)Can a black man build a house in your country and invest there?
 (2)Can a black man be given staying permit and be allowed to visit sight seen?
 I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the trasfer.Your prompt response via my email is highly envisaged;your response will make me act accordingly upon the receipt of your mail. I will be waiting to hear from you for further guidelines. If you accept this offer
 I will appreciate your timely response.
 Bye for now and thanks for your understanding.
 Best regards

 Dear Friend

 I Mr.Sami mohammad\xa0the Chairman of\xa0 Contract Awarding Committee of\xa0 the EUROPEAN UNION CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT(ECC)\xa0 in BURKINA FASO West Africa. I got your information in a business directory from the Burkina Faso Chamber of Commerce and ndustries
 when I was searching for a reliable
 honest and trust worthy person to entrust this business with. I was simply inspired and 
 "We wish to transfer the sum of USD$36.000
000.00 (Thirty Six million United States Dollars only.) into your personal or companys bank account. This fund was a residue of the over invoiced contract bills awarded by us for the supply of\xa0 equiment
hard/soft\xa0 wares
 pharmaceuticals/medical items relating to constructing tools
 light and heavy duty vehicles
 apparels and other administrative logistics etc for the Burkina Faso Projects. This DEAL was deliberately hatched out and carefully protected with all the attendant loop holes sealed off. As the Chairman of CAC
 I have the cooperation and mandate of the Financial Director and the Secretary of the Organisation. We arranged and over invoiced the contract funds supplied by different companies from different countries. It was our consensus to seek the assistance of a willing foreigner to provide us with the facilities to transfer this money out of Burkina Faso.&lt;"
 This is borne out of our belief in the non-stable and sporous political nature of this sub-egion.The original contractors have been duly paid by the Bank of Africa Ouaga-Burkina-Faso in West Africa. (Bank of Africa
 Ouaga-Burkina-Faso in West Africa). Through our bankers - Societe\xa0 Generale 
 Banque. This balance is suspended in the escrow accounts awaiting claims by any foreign company of our choice. We intend to pay out this fund NOW as the organization is winding up its activities and the coast has been achieved. </p>
 Based on the laws and ethics of employment
 we as civil servants working under this organization
 are not allowed to operate a foreign account. This is the more reason why we needed your assistance to provide an account that can sustain this fund for safe keeping and our future investment with your comprehensive advise
 assistance and partnership in your country.It is however agreed
 as the account owner in this deal to allow you 30% of the entire sum as compensation
 60% will be held on trust for us while 10% will be used to defray any incidental charges and cost during the course of the transaction.
 Yours Faithfully.

 Compliment Of The Season
 
 On a very good day. I am (jerry kabore\xa0Esq)
The Head of file Department in African developent bank (ADB).I got your contact from Yahoo tourist search.
 When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your capability and reliability to champion this businees opportunity when i prayed to God or
   Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death
 we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines
 but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it 
  and we don’t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.
 The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years
 the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner
 and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner
 in respect to the provision of a foreign account
 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague. There after i will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. 
 Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged
 you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name
 your bank account number
 your private 
  telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply
 I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for thetransfer. 
 You should contact me on my number 00226-7885 75 97
 immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.

Dear
 "Am a widow and a mother of two girls. We do not know each other and Im wondering how you will view this letter. Please
 accept my sincere apology. Sorry
 about taking your time as well. I will be highly obliged if you can assist me in this business. My Husband is an Nigerian while I am a Ghanaian. My late husband
 David Ameeraly
 was a loving
 caring and hardworking businessman. Prior to his death by plane crash
 he was living with us in Accra
 Ghana. He died November 1st 1990. This sad event occurred during one of his business trips to the US. Please
 find below the website for more information. If you go through this publication critically
 you will find my husbands name
 David Ameeraly amongst others that lost their life on that fateful day as published by British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stmB"
 Before the sudden death of my beloved husband
 he planned to establish a business in Europe with the sum of US$ 21.5 Dollars (Twenty One Million
 five hundred thousand Dollars only). Unfortunately
 he died before this venture could materialize. Following his death
 his family members insisted that I am not entitled to his properties (assets and money).
 Since I am a woman and my offsprings are all girls coupled with the fact that I do not have a male child
 I was put under terrible pressure to stay clear from my legitimate husband estates According to their family culture/traditional believe
 a woman is not allowed to run late
 "husband business and worst of all
 I was asked to move into Davids younger brothers household as one of his wives. My problem started when I refused to be inherited by Davids younger brother. Fortunately
  the proposed investment fund US$ 21.5 Dollars (Twenty One Million
 five hundred thousand Dollars only). that was deposited with the investment/security company was unknown to the family. As such
 they did not ask for this. If not
 it would have been a problem as there would have been nothing to fall back on. Its only our lawyer &amp; my humble self that know of this fund. I have discussed this matter with the Finance company were the fund was lodged. This is the asset I have left and I need part of this money for my daughters school fees and to maintain my personal life as well. Davids family was vehemently against my daughters education. All they intend doing
"
 was to give them out for marriage at a tender age. According to the staff of the finance company
 the best way to secure this money is to transfer this money into an alternative bank account for safekeeping.
 Later it will be used for business investment which is subject to the advise of whoever that will be assisting us finally.
 "For obvious reasons
 I do not want the finance companys involvement."
 This transaction must be handled under strict confidentiality. At this juncture
 I thought it wise to solicit your indispensable assistance to receiving this fund on my behalf. I do not have knowledge of funds management &amp; business in general. I was a full-time housewife.
 Therefore
 this step depends on your trust-worthiness &amp; ability to handle funds of this magnitude. All that is required of you
 is to forward to me by email
 your direct phone
 fax
 address or any other information you may deem helpful. I need the requested information for the purpose of securing the relevant documents in your name as my confidante/ bona fide beneficiary. Please
 note that this transaction is legitimate and 100% hitch-free. We will not violate any known law of my country and that of yours. So
 be rest-assured.
 However
 as soon as I receive your positive response to the above business transaction
 I shall provide you with necessary transfer details. Note also
 that you must convince me of your trust-worthiness and ability to keep secret. I have decided to compensate you with 30%
 "of the total money as a reward for your sincere assistance and the remaining 70% will be used to pursue my late husbands investment dream in real estate."
 Thanking you for your anticipated response as I look forward to hearing
 from you.
 I remain.
 Sincerely yours

 Mrs.Rose David Ameeraly

 Attention Please
</p>
 I am Mr Mohamat Ali
 the Director in charge of Auditing and Accounting section of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Africa. With due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction .</p>
 During our investigation and auditing in this bank
 my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development.</p>
 The said amount was U.S 7.5M (Seven Million
Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). As it may interest you to know
 I got your impressive information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased
 get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist
 and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity.</p>
 In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant(A Banker)
we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.</p>
 I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On smooth conclusion of this transaction
 you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification
 while 10% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and internet bills
 while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please
 you have been adviced to keep "Top Secret" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.</p>
 I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment
 either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when I hear from you.</p>
 I look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication

 Before his death on the 25th December 2003
 Mr.Lund has a fixed deposit account with the bank and no other person know about this account or have any information relating to this account. The account has no beneficiary nor next-of-kin other than him
 My investigation reveal that his supposed next-of-kin died along with him in the crash. Since then
 I have made several enquiries to locate any of his extended relatives
 this has also proved unsuccessful.
 "After several unsuccessful attempts
 I decided to contact you.Im contacting you to assist in remittance of a dormant fund as the next of kin left behind by Mr.Lund so as not to allow the bank confiscate or declare the funds unserviceable in the account according to Benin Republic financial law on unclaimed bills which the government usually map out for the purchase of ammunitions which are the major course of conflicts in the west of  Africa. Consequently
 Im seeking your consent to present you as the next-of-kin to the deceased customer so that the outstanding fixed deposit (US$24.1M) will be remitted into any designated account of yours to be shared by both of us in the ratio of 60% to me and 40% for you."
 I have all necessary legal documents to back up this claim. All that is required of you is absolute honesty
 total commitment
 co-operation &amp; absolute confidentiality. Be rest-assured that this transaction will be executed under legitimate arrangement that will protect both parties from breach of the law and it is 100% risk free and attracts no authorities and every information you will require as the next of kin will be forwarded to you after your final acceptance to help me champion this deal.

   I am the first duaghter of an ex military/ex president been an opposition party to the present Government of COTE D`IVOIRE. On the 19th sept 2002 my father/mother including every members of our family was murdered by the unknown REBELS during the time they attack our house by shooting and looting
 even this is one of the things that contributed to the present crisis in our country today. 
   God so kind I was not in town when the incident occurred
 the plans of the REBELS is to kill every members of our family so that no one will rise up to revenge as time goes on. I am in our country without any one knowing although I am on hiding so that the unknown REBELS will not get to me and kill me like they killed all the members of our family. Why I still stay back in our country is to transfer the $18.5mUSD which my late
  father deposited in the custody.
   he deposited the fund as a family treasure containing AFRICAN ART WORK FOR EXPORT for security reasons
 as security company does not operate as bank where some one can deposit his/her money openly. 
 Before the death of my father he gave me the covering documents of the fund deposited in the security company
 as I am his first duaghter and he so much loved me that was why he made me the beneficiary of the two iron trunk boxes containing the $18.5mUSD. Right now I wish to transfer this fund to you so that you will assist me to invest the money into any viable sector in your country
 also you will help me to join you in your country for me to start up a new life with you there immediately the fund gets to you. since I am no longer safe as far as Africa is concern at the moment
 I wanted to transfer the fund before leaving the country because this fund is my last hope and the only hope I have now.

 Compliment Of The Season
 
 When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your capability and reliability to champion this businees opportunity when i 
 prayed to God or Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death
 we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relati on to the deceased as indica ted in our banking guidelines
 but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the 
 next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don’t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.
 The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years
 the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner
 and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner
 in respect to the provision of a foreign account
 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague. There after i will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. 
 Therefore to enable 
 the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged
 you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name
 your bank account number
 your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply
 I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for thetransfer. 
 You should contact me on my number 00226-7885 75 97\xa0immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.

 In brief
 I am financial adviser to a private security firm in Bangkok
 Thailand. Lately my department
 discovered fund deposited by a Mr. Saeed Bin Khadir
 an Iraqi national. The fund was deposited since
 April 2003
 and till this moment Mr. Saeed has not been located. Our extensive inquiry shows that he
 may have been one of those killed in Iraqi by bomb. All efforts to locate a family member or next of kin
 resulted in nothing. At long last
 I and my immediate boss decided to look for honest individual who 
 "could be fronted as Mr. Saeeds business partner so that we could move the fund to the third country
 for "
 investment purposes. 
 I will provide you with the rest of the details if you indicate your interest in helping us out
 you will
 be rewarded accordingly.

\xa0 Compliment of the season to you and your family. My name is MAYILVAHINI\xa0 MURUGAJYAN\xa0 CASARATE\xa0 Indian by origin and Ivorian citizen by marriage abduction. I want you to read this mail very carefully with and open mind
 and may God bless you as you are following it up on humanitarian basis.
 \xa0 I am an India woman who got married to a military General in Ivorian Army. Late Gen. LAJA CASARATE. who died of rescent in November 24th 2005
\xa0 in a military hospital although some of his colleagues and friends said he was killed by a witch craft from his family.\xa0
 \xa0 I have only One son
 with my late husband and whose name is BONNE 
 CASARATE
 my main aim of writing you this message is that immediately the Doctor announced that my late husband has given up
 his so called brothers came and drove me and my son out of the house and lock up the place. And they claimed that my late husband has a se!
  cond wife
  that had two children for him before he got married to me. 
 "\xa0 They insisted that me and my son should go back to India and stay till the family would decide on the sharing of our property. This was a very big shock to me that almost damged my health
 i can not go back to India because my parents refused me to marry my late husband initially. But as a young lady that was in love
 i had to run away from India with my late husband down to Abidjan- Cote d ivoire when he was a Captain in 1987. Then my husband led an Ivorian Military troupe on a mission to India."
 "\xa0 It is true that my parents collected money from a rich family in India
 who\xa0 wanted me to get married to their son. I had to run away to my late husband in Abidjan - Cote d ivoire
 until this year\xa0January 20th\xa0when i travelled to india
 everyone disowned me
 no one wanted to talk to me."
   Few months ago
 my husband brought one box into the h!
  ouse and
  told me that the box was\xa0 seized from the rebel in Bouake
 and he opened the box in my presence
 which was full of United States Dollars
 he told me that the box contained USD20million and we both went to keep it somewhere. His plans was to use the money to contest for the forthcoming presidential election in 2006 before his death. None of his family member is aware of this fund except myself and my son Bonne.
 \xa0 I am hereby seeking your advice and your assistance on how to get this funds out of this country and also want to seek advice if there is any profitable business that i can invest this money on in your country.
   \xa0 Please kindly keep this confidential and may God bless.\xa0

  Compliments of the season. I am Mrs.\xa0Rose Bangra\xa0Hamenya
 a civil servant from Zimbabwe.\xa0I got your contact from\xa0Chamber and Commerce office as\xa0I was searching for someone who will help me\xa0 out of\xa0my present\xa0predicament
 
 "  My late husband
 Mr. Ransome Gatorgay Hamenya was the co-owner of an Agricultural firm and his partner happens to be among the white farmers that the dictator President of Zimbabwe
 Robert Mugabe took over their farmlands and handed over to the blacks
 despite all the pleas from the International Community
and members of the\xa0commonwealth countrys Most of the"
 " companys assets
animal farms and milk industry were seized and confiscated by the tyrant President. "
 "  My late husband was a British citizen of African descent and we both lived in the companys staff quarters but our lives were threatened by agents of President Mugabe. Since then
 my husband and I have been living in exile in Dakar - Senegal. My husband died last August as a result of cardiac arrest. "
   A\xa0substential\xa0amount of money was deposited in the\xa0finance house by\xa0my husband before his death through the help of the International Red Cross staff
 because President Mugabe
 placed order for the closure of the accounts of all the white farmers and no one is allowed to transfer more than ten thousand dollars abroad but luckily enough
 I and my late husband along with some other farmers were
  assisted through diplomatic means with the help of the International Red Cross to send our money abroad.
 The total Sum is\xa0FIFTEEN million US dollars (US$15.000.000.)
 
 the money is part of our savings and what my husband inherited from his late father
 from whom we took over the family business.\xa0 All the documents to the deposition of the money are with me\xa0and with the finance firm also for Security reasons. 
 I would like you to assist me to relocate the money to your country into any account of your choice or keep it for me in your safe custody until I am able to come to your country after my operation soon. I would like to invest the money into any lucrative business
 you deem profitable and your assistance is highly needed in the areas of investment feasibility studies. 
   Hence I need your cooperation to secure this deposit which is as it stands now
 the only hope of\xa0my
 " survival as I have already lost my husband
 coupled with my sickness and the situation of insecurity. Life is no more the same with me after all the lot I have gone through.Moreover
 I wouldnt mind paying you any amount you will charge me up\xa0to 20% of the total money for your assistance in relocating and keeping the money for me as well as helping me to carry out proper investment. You keep 80% for me pending execution of the investment. "
   As a sick person
 it will be difficult to handle this alone
 hence I need your immense help
 coupled with your distinguished business acumen and track record. Please
 I would like you to come to my assistance
 I am a lonely widow and in utter confusion and distress.
   \xa0This business is solely between two of us and should there be any need for a third party
 I will contact one of the Red Cross staff with whom I have
  established some trust. I am scared that if any one gets to know about this
 he might take advantage of my helpless situation. to diverte this fund or seat on the money without helping me to manageit as planed
so please if your willing to help kindly contact me through my email above. or my son\s email id (<a shape="rect" href="mailto:papis_prince@hotmail.com">papis_prince@hotmail.com</a>)

 Email:da_sarr@katamail.com
  I know this email will reach you as a surprise
 but need not to worry as i am using the only secured and confidential medium available to seek for foreign assistance in a business.
  I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail.
  I am contacting you concerning a customer and deposit placed under our banks management 10 years ago
i am contacting you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication.
  I am Mr.David Saar from Ecobank
Dakar-Senegal.Branch.This business request may seem strange
 but I crave your indulgence and pray you view it seriously as I am convinced that you would be capable to provide me with a solution to a money transfer.
  On 6th
june
1997
 a Nigerian came to make a (fixed) deposit valued at US$10
500
000.00(Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars )in  my branch to be claimed by a foreing beneficiary to be later named
upon maturity
we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.
  After three years of sending reminder with no responce
we decided to open an investigation
and i was the head of the panel set up for the investigation
in the course of our investigation i finally discovered the money was Part of the loot the late Nigerian Ruler General Sani Abacha stole from Nigeria
the money was deposited under a false name. you can  confirm it yourself via the website below.
 http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/columnists/wickham/2002-04-19-wickham.htm.
  On further investigation
 I found out that no one knows of the deposit not even his family members he died without telling any one of it.Therefore he did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his documents
 including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank as the deposit was a secret one
so i decided to keep the secret to my self as i view this as a once in a lifetime oportunity for me.
  My bank has waited for the beneficiary to come and make claims but no one has ever come forward
the reason is that he was yet to name the beneficiary before he died and i am the only one aware of this fact because i am the one in charge of the transaction.
 " This sum of US$10
500
000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the  principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it According to my Countrys law
 at the expiration of 10(TEN)years
the money will revert to the ownership of the SENEGALESE Government if nobody  applies to claim the fund."
  Consequently
 my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to  stand as the beneficiary to the deposit so that the money will not get into the hands of some corrupt Government officials. I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you in a few days.
  I will simply inform our bank of the final closing of the file relating to the deposit.This is simple
upon your approval
I will like you to
 provide immediately your full name and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the beneficiary.
  We shall employ the service of two attorneys for the drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter  of probate administration in your favour for the transfer.
  Any bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will  then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary.
  There is no risk at all;i have waited eigth(8)years now to be very sure of this plan
the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested
 please reply immediately via the private email address below
 upon your response
 I shall provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.
  Please observe outmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this  transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.
  Please upon your approval of this mail message
 send to me the following  to enable me start the processing of the fund transfer into your bank account:
  I am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive or destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you
 delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal. You may not know this but people like me who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole banking sector.
 and let me move on with my life but please do not destroy me.I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide my family with new opportunities.
  There is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking.I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank.
  Awaiting your Urgent Reply via my private email:da_sarr@katamail.com or call me on
 my private telephone number: +221-4488469 for further discussion.

 Greetings to you

 This letter must come to you as a big surprise
 but I believe it is only a day that people meet and become great friends and business partners.My name is Mr.Henry Carr
 the present branch Manager of a bank here in Nigeria West Africa. I write you this proposal in good faith
 believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you. LikeI said
 I have a transaction that will benefit both of us
 as your assistance is required as a foreigner.
 I use to head the Accounts department in my bank head office
 but last December I was asked to take position of a Manager of our branch in Lagos who passed on
so that was how I became the present Manager and discovered a fortune. As I resumed duty
 I discovered an account with total sum of $10.5 million that has not been operated on for the past 4 years.From my investigation
I found out that this account belongs to one Late Mr. Ziya Bazhayev a Russian big time Oildealer
 who unfortunately lost his life in the Yak-40jetliner on March 9
 2000. You will read more news about the crash on visiting these site; 
 http://www.amarillonet.com/stories/031500/usn_LA0703.001.shtml and
 http://news.1chinastar.com/ll/english/61934.shtml.
 I have kept a close monitoring of the account since then and nobody has come forward to claim the  money as next of kin to the late Mr. Ziya Bazhayev meaning that no one is aware of the account. I can not directly take out this money without the help of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance to claim the funds and share it with me. As the Manager of my bank branch
 I have the power to influence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account
 with the correct information concerning the account
 which I shall give you.I am seeking your co -operation to present you as the next of kin to the account. There is practically no risk involved
 the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law.If you accept to work with me
 I want you to state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage
 so that both parties will be satisfied. Contact me as soon as you receive this message if you feel we can work together
so as to give you more details.
 Thanking you in advance and may God bless you.
 Please
 treat with utmost confidentiality.
 I wait your urgent response.

22 years old and the only daughter of my late parents MR.and MRS MUSTAPHA KONE. My father was a highly reputable busnness magnet-(a cocoa merchant)who operated in the capital of Ivory coast during his days. It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad year 12th.Febuary 2004.Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of his who travelled with him at that time.
 "But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 4 years old
 and since then my father took me so special. Before his death on Febuary 12th 2004 he called the secretary who accompanied him to the hospital and told him that he has the sum of\xa0Ten million \xa0United State Dollars.(USD$10 million) left in a security company in a mettalic trunk box
 but the security company didnt know the content because it was registered as family valuables personal for security reasons. "
 "I am just 22 years old and a university undergraduate and really dont know what to do. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of incessant political crisis here in Ivory coast. The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life. Sir
I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards.Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded. Now permit me to ask these few questions:- "
 1. Can I completely trust you?
 2. What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for you? 
 Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible.
 Thank you so much. 
 My sincere regards

 Compliment Of The Season
 
 When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your capability and reliability to champion this businees opportunity when i 
 prayed to God or Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death
 we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relati on to the deceased as indica ted in our banking guidelines
 but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the 
 next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don’t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.
 The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years
 the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner
 and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner
 in respect to the provision of a foreign account
 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague. There after i will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. 
 Therefore to enable 
 the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged
 you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name
 your bank account number
 your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply
 I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for thetransfer. 
 You should contact me on my number 00226-7885 75 97\xa0immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately. 
 Your’s faithfully
\xa0
 Trevor Gumel\xa0\xa0(Esq.)

 SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to enable the transfer to move very smoothly in to the account you will prove to the bank.As you finished reading this letter call me immediately so that we discuss very well over this 
 business.

He instructed me to look for a trust worthy partner in over sea to confide the release of the fund into his account and relocate to his country to establish the money on a lucrative business and live my life quietly. He also said that the security company does not know the
  content of the safe Box
 that he\xa0deposited the contents as family valuable.
 Why am contacting you

 I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked 
 members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money 
 which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan
 they 
 refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence
 I do not trust them 
 anymore
 as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them.

 MANAGER:ECOBANK.
 DAKAR-SENEGAL.Branch.
 Email:da_sarr@katamail.com
  I know this email will reach you as a surprise
 but need not to worry as i am using the only secured and confidential medium available to seek for foreign assistance in a business.
  I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail.
  I am contacting you concerning a customer and deposit placed under our banks management 10 years ago
i am contacting you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication.
  I am Mr.David Saar from Ecobank
Dakar-Senegal.Branch.This business request may seem strange
 but I crave your indulgence and pray you view it seriously as I am convinced that you would be capable to provide me with a solution to a money transfer.
  On 6th
june
1997
 a Nigerian came to make a (fixed) deposit valued at US$10
500
000.00(Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars )in  my branch to be claimed by a foreing beneficiary to be later named
upon maturity
we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.
  After three years of sending reminder with no responce
we decided to open an investigation
and i was the head of the panel set up for the investigation
in the course of our investigation i finally discovered the money was Part of the loot the late Nigerian Ruler General Sani Abacha stole from Nigeria
the money was deposited under a false name. you can  confirm it yourself via the website below. 
 http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/columnists/wickham/2002-04-19-wickham.htm.
  On further investigation
 I found out that no one knows of the deposit not even his family members he died without telling any one of it.Therefore he did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his documents
 including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank as the deposit was a secret one
so i decided to keep the secret to my self as i view this as a once in a lifetime oportunity for me.
  My bank has waited for the beneficiary to come and make claims but no one has ever come forward
the reason is that he was yet to name the beneficiary before he died and i am the only one aware of this fact because i am the one in charge of the transaction. 
 " This sum of US$10
500
000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the  principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it According to my Countrys law
 at the expiration of 10(TEN)years
the money will revert to the ownership of the SENEGALESE Government if nobody  applies to claim the fund."
  Consequently
 my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to  stand as the beneficiary to the deposit so that the money will not get into the hands of some corrupt Government officials. I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you in a few days. 
  I will simply inform our bank of the final closing of the file relating to the deposit.This is simple
upon your approval
I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the beneficiary.
  We shall employ the service of two attorneys for the drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter  of probate administration in your favour for the transfer.
  Any bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will  then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary.
  There is no risk at all;i have waited eigth(8)years now to be very sure of this plan
the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested
 please reply immediately via the private email address below
 upon your response
 I shall provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.
  Please observe outmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this  transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.
 " Please upon your approval of this mail message
 send to me the following  to enable me start the processing of the fund transfer into your bank account:1.) The beneficiarys name and complete info.2.) Your private / official telephone and fax number."
  I am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive or destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you
 delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal. You may not know this but people like me who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole banking sector.
 " I do not find this move against good conscience
 this may be hard for you to understand
 but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come ones way once in a lifetime. I cannot afford to let this chance pass me by
 for once I find myself in total control of my destiny. This is my chance and I wont let it pass me by.If you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but please do not destroy me.I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide my family with new opportunities. "
  There is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking.I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank.
  Awaiting your Urgent Reply via my private email:da_sarr@katamail.com or call me on my private telephone number: +221-4488469 for further discussion.

 Dearest Beloved

 In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $10 million Ten million united states dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer the Late Mr Smith B.Andrea an American oil engineer with Petro Technical Services Sarl who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000
 including his wife. 
 Since we got information about his death
 we have been expecting his next of kin or relatives to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.
 Unfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin being his wife [Patty Andrea] died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the knowledge of this fund behind for the claim. 
 "It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin or beneficiary of the funds for safety keeping and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want this money to go back into Government treasury as unclaimed bill. "
 The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained after six and half years
 the money will then be transferred into Government treasury as unclaimed funds. 
 I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as the foreign partner
 while the balance will be for me. I will visit your country for the disbursement according to the percentages indicated above once this money gets into your account. 
 Please be honest to me and trust is our watchword in this transaction. Note this transaction is confidential and risk free.
 As soon as you receive this mail you should contact me by return mail.Please note that all necessary arrangement for the smooth release of these funds to your yet to be provided account has been finalised. 
 We will discuss much in details when I do receive your response. Please in your response include your telephone number for easy communication between us.
 Best Regards

 Dr Eric Morgan.

 First and foremost
 I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction / business of this magnitude
 but this is due to Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. In unfolding this proposal
 I want to count on you
 as a respected and honest person to handle this transaction with sincerity
 trust and confidentiality. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the transaction described hereunder for the benefit of all parties involved and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of
  the nature of this transaction.
 Because of what is happening in the world today and to verify my predicaments as well as my sincerity

 Because of my father’s sincerity
 he was killed by a planned motor accident along Harare-Masvingo Road near Mvuma Province of Zimbabwe. But before his untimely death
 my father told me some few weeks earlier that he kept a box with a private Security and finance Company in Johannesburg
 South Africa which contains US$20.5 Million (Twenty million
 five hundred thousand United States dollars).
  He warned that he only declared the contents of the box to the Security and finance Company as family treasure/ valuables
 with insurance values of the said amount. He also told me that he used my name as the beneficiary of this money being his first child.
 The original document that shows the Deed of lodge
 Proof of Deposit
 and Depository Agreement between my late father and the Management of the Security Company was kept with my mother.
 After my father’s death
 mother
 my little sister and I ran to South Africa to seek asylum for our lives. Because of the South African financial law which prohibits asylum seekers/refugees like my mother and I to open bank account or involve in any financial transaction
 I decided to write to you to seek your assistance for this money to be transferred into your company’s or personal bank account while all arrangement for a hitch free transfer have been fully taken care of.
 I have the authority of my family
  to propose that should you be willing to assist us in this transaction your share as compensation will be US$5.125m (25%)
 while my family takes US$13.325m (65%) and the balance of US$2.5m (10%) for miscellaneous expenses that may be incurred by either party during the transfer.
 I want to let you know that this transaction is 100% risk free provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality because the Zimbabwean Government are bent on collecting\xa0 all assets / properties belonging to my late father.
 Please
 I do hope that this money will be safe when finally transferred into your account and I do hope of establishing a good relationship with you and your family after this transaction. I wait to hear from you.

 I am the above named person from South Africa. I am married to Mr.GREOGE  SANKOH  who worked with South African embassy in Ivory Coast for nine years before he died in the year 2002. We were married for eleven years without a child. 
 He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians.Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against.
 "When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of 5.5Million U.S.(FIVE MILLION FIVE HUNDERD thousand Dollars) in a trunk box in one ( Security And Finance Company) in cote d ivoire.Presently
 this money is still with the Security And Finance Company. Recently
 my Doctor told me that I would notlast for the next two years due to cancer problem."
 Though what disturbs me most is my stroke Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to church or better still a christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. 
 I want a church that will use this to fund churches
 orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth.

Dear friend

 On behalf of my colleagues and I
I write this letter with great pleasure. Your information were given to me by a member of the South African Export Promotion Council (SAEPC) who was with the Black Economic Empowerment Commission (Government)delegation on a trip to the United States during a bilateral conference talk to encourage foreign investors.I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in execution of a business transaction hereunder for the benefit of all parties.Within the Department of Mining Resources where I work as the Director of Project Implementation
with co-operation of two other top officials
we have in our possession
 an overdue payment in US funds.The said funds represent certain percentage of the contract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by a foreign contracting firm
which we the officials over-invoiced to the amount of US$18
300
000.00(Eighteen Million
 Three Hundred Thousand UnitedStates Dollars)
  . Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor
leaving the excess balance unclaimed.The Government of the Republic of South Africa believe that private investment in general
and foreign direct investment in particular
are the
 real engines for sustainable economic development
for which reason it has continued to encourage investment in the key growth-oriented sector of Mining with sincere
 "determination to pay foreign contractors all debts owed to them
so as to continue to enjoy close relationship
and a mutually beneficial co-operation with foreign governments and non-governmental financial agencies. As a result we included our bills for approvals with the co-operation of some officials at the Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank of South Africa (RBSA).We are seeking your assistance to be the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds
 since we are not allowed to operate a foreign account. The changing of beneficiarys information/details and other forms of documentation upon application for claim to reflect the contract money and its"
 approvals will be secured on behalf of your company or your good self.I have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that
 should you be willing to assist us in this transaction your share as compensation will be 30% while my colleagues and I shall receive 60%
 and the balance of 10% shall be used to reimburse all expenditures
 taxes and miscellaneous expenses so incurred.It does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of the nature described here. The assumption is that your company won the major contract and subcontracted it to other companies.More often than not
 big trading companies and firms of unrelated fields win major contracts
and subcontract to more specialized firms for execution.
 This business itself is 100% safe
 provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality. Also your Specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this mutual beneficiary transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint us.Kindly notify me by email engridris_moha@myway.com  for further details
 upon your acceptance of this proposal.
 Your Sincerely

 Engr.Idris Moha.

 NIGERIA.
 Dear Friend

 I am a director in the foreign affairs department of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). I got your email during a Personal research on the Internet and wish to use this opportunity to notify you of the existence of a certain amount we wish to transfer Overseas for the purpose of investments and importation of goods from your country.
 In May 2003
 a contract of sixty-six million United States dollars ($66
000
000) was awarded to a foreign company by my ministry. The Contract was supply
 erection and system optimization of supper polyore200
000-bpsd
 system optimization of 280
000-monax axial plants and the computerization of conveyor belt for Kaduna refinery. With the Consent of only the head of the contract evaluation department
 I over Invoiced the contract value by thirty four million
 The contract has since been completed and the foreign company fully paid off. But
 in the office files and paper work
 the company is still owed USD34M representing the over invoiced amount. Because this amount is derived from the award and execution of a foreign contract
 there is no way the money can be paid locally. That is why I am contacting you so that we can do the project together for our mutual benefit. We have concluded every necessary arrangement to transfer this amount to a foreign account as the final phase payment for the said contract.
 I solicit your assistance to enable us transfer the said amount into your safe bank account and after we shall come over there to share the money with you. You can either provide us with an existing account or to set up a new bank account immediately to receive this money
 even an empty a/c can serve to receive this money
 as long as you will remain honest to me till the end of this important business trusting in you and believing that you will never let me down either now or in future.
 We sincerely need an honest person to work with and have agreed to share the money in the following percentages
 65% will be for us
 30% will be for you whose account is used to secure the funds and 5% will be used to settle every expenses incurred during the transaction like air tickets etc. There is no risk involvement because applications will be made to the concerned Federal ministries and parastatals with official approvals given by the Federal government before the Central bank of Nigeria will be officially authorized to wire the funds to your nominated bank account by telegraphic transfer. Those involved over here are directors in the ministry
 they know how best to effect the transfer and will come over there to collect their own share.
 If you are interested
 contact me via email indicating your full names
company/business name and address. Your direct telephone and fax numbers for effective communication. The name and address of the bank you will like us to deposit the money
 the telephone and fax numbers of the bank
 the account name and number etc. Everything has been arranged and I will send more information about the business transaction to you as soon as I hear from you. For obvious reasons
 please keep the proposal top secret.
 Kind regards

 we learnt that all his supposed next of kin died alongside with him at the

such money will be moved into the banking treasurer as unclaimed fund.

     MY NAME IS MR MR Ken Edward
A former government official of Liberia. Following the exit of president CharlesTaylor of Liberia from power under a West African brokered peace agreement
 led by Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo he was granted asylum by the Nigerian Government. In my position as the Financial Secretary to the President and close confidant
 I left for Nigeria in his Entourage. My country has been engulfed in Protracted Civil war with rebels controlling some parts of the country. During the war
 President Taylor disbursed large sums of Monies to buy the loyalty of the entire cabinet
 and I can say with all modesty that I was one of the Chief Beneficiaries of this disbursement.
 This is aside from monies I used my official position to acquire while in office. Since we relocated to Calabar
 Southern Nigeria all has been well
 but with the recent indictment of former President Taylor by the war crime tribunal sitting in Sierra Leone and confirmed re ports of a dedicated fund by the American Government to capture him in order to face war crime charges have now decided to leave the country. Presently I have funds totaling United State $15
000
000.(Fifteen Million US Dollars) Which I intend to move oversea for investment and spend the rest of my life there with my family.
 This transaction is risk-free as all local arrangement has been made. If you are prepared to assist to work with me I require the following: Your Full Name and Office or House Address
Your Occupation
 Your Private Telephone
 Fax Num
 ber and private Email Address. As Compensation for your assistance you will retain 15% of the Total sum
 While 5% will be mapped out for local and International expenses.
 Though we are not known to each other
 I strongly believe that through this transaction we would be able to forge a mutually beneficial relationship between us
 now and in the future. Finally
 the success of this transaction will depend to a great extent on mutual trust
 secrecy and Confidentiality from you. I await your response by private E-mail ;(edward22ken@yahoo.it)

 but the security company didnt know the content because it was decleared as family valuables personal for security reasons. "
 "I am just 20years old and a university undergraduate and really dont know what to do. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of incessant political crisis here in Ivory co!"

 I am Edwin Useni
 a director in the project and planning department of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC)
 I head a seven man Tenders Board Committee in charge of contract award and Payment approvals. I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction
 which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account.  
 There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of Multinationals in the oil industry in favor of the (NNPC) among which were;  
 1) The expansion of Pipeline network within Nigeria for crude oil and downstream products distribution and subsequent evacuation - US$2 Billion.  
 2) Contract for Turn Around Maintenance (TAM) of various Refineries in the country.  
 3) The construction of Storage Tanks for Petroleum Product (Depots)-US$94 Million.  
 The original value of these contracts were deliberately over invoiced in the sum of Twenty Five million
 Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars US$25
500
000.00) which has recently been approved and now ready to be transferred. However the companies that actually executed the aforementioned contract have been fully paid and the projects officially commissioned.  
 Consequently
 my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount into your account for subsequent disbursement
 since we as civil servants are prohibited by the Co
 de of Conduct Bureau (Civil Service Laws) from opening and/or operating foreign accounts in our names. 
 Needless to say
 the trust reposed in you at this juncture is enormous. In return
 we have agreed amongst ourselves to offer you 15% of the transferred sum
 5% shall be set aside for any incidental expenses during the course of this transaction
 you will then be mandated to revert the balance to us in due course.  
 You must however NOTE that this transaction is subject to the following terms and conditions; our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence
 that you must accord this transaction with utmost confidentiality and secrecy.  
 Modalities have been worked out at the highest levels of the Ministry 0f Finance
 Central Bank of Nigeria and the Presidential Task Force on Contract Payment for the immediate remittance of the funds within 10 - 14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above terms.  
 Our assurance is that your role shall be totally risk-free. To accord this transaction the legality it deserves
 and for mutual security of funds
 the whole procedures shall be legally processed with your name or any company you may nominate as the bona fide final beneficiary.  
 Once more
 I want you to understand that having put in over 20 years in the Civil Service of my country
 I am very much averse to having my image and career dented. This matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency. Kindly expedite immediate action as we are well behind schedule to enable us include this transfer in the second batch of the 2001 fiscal year contract payments.

   Sorry to say that I never know the caring of my mother because she died when I was just 4 years old which made me the best man for my late father and he never hide anything from me.

 "I am contacting you believing you are a honest and trustworthy person.I believe you will not betray the confidence I am willing to repose in you
 for me to have contacted you even though weve not met before."
 My name is Martin Goudalé
the only son of late Mr.Hassan Goudalé
 who was the chairman /President/CEO
Cacao-Cafe &amp; Agro-Alimentary industries plc.SCAFECAO)"Bouake" and ex-owner of Polyclinic LA-MADONNE
 of the Republic of Cote d\Ivoire.
 You can find the story on this
 website:http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2269238.stm
 "On 19th of September 2002
a group of so called rebels took over the city of Bouake to over-throw the Government of Mr.Laurent Gbagbo the President of Cote dIvoire. On the 20th day morning at about 4:18am some fractions of the same group of rebels break into our house and killed our security guard and pass-through the gate entrance to the main building and took my father away to an un-known destination."
 After about four hours later we found him (my father) at the road side
 by then he had been totally beaten and was bleeding to death lying in the pool of his own blood. From there
 we rushed him to a near by hospital and hours later he sent for my mother. So he told her that he can not make it from the doctors diagnosis
 he also told her that it was because he (my father) was not from the northern part of the country that he has been treated this way and also being a political activist. And again he said he is suspecting some of his business partners for conspiracy and this sort of brutality. He also told my mother that he deposited a huge amount of money i.e US$ 10.5million dollars(Ten million five hundred thousand us dollars only)in a Finance House and also told her where he kept the whole documents concerning this deposit that is made for investment purpose in the western world.
 That same day
 he (my father) gave up the ghost. Then with the help of the French soldiers
 we escaped to Senegal
 where we are now. I am now contacting you believing you are honest and trustworthy to help us to receive the money in your account for investment
 I and my mother has decided in compensating you 20%of the total amount for your assistance .
 Please do take your time to go through the mail and get back to us
 so that I will simply introduce to the Finance House where the fund are being kept now for onward transfer.
 I am waiting for your response.
 Thanks and God bless.

 Sincerely

I am Mrs Mariam Afonso I was married to Mr. Moses Afonso
 "who was a contractor with the government of Cote DIvoire before he died in the year 2002 after few days in the hospital. The doctor said his death was as a result of poison."
 We were married for so many years without a child.Before his death we were both born again Christian. Since his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $25 Million usa dollars with a security company here in Cote D lvoire Presently this money is still in the custody of the security company in Cote D lvoire. 
 Recently
 my Doctor told me that it is very likely i will die within the next nine months due to cancer problem.Having known my condition I decided to donate
 this fund to a church
organization or good person that will utilize  this money the way I am going to instruct herein.
 I want a church
organization or good person that will use this fund for orphanages
 widows and other people that need help and also propagating the word of God and to endeavor that the house of God is maintained.
 The Bible made us to understand that"Blessed is the hand that giveth". l took this decision because I don\t have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians not even good at all because they are the one that responsible for the death of my husband in other to have all my late husband\s property and I don\t want my husband\s efforts to be used by those that conspired for his death.
 "I dont want them to know about this development and l know that With God all things are possible This is why I am taking this decision.Though it was very painful to hear this kind of news from my doctor but I am notafraid of death because I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. I dont think there is need for any telephone communication in this regard because of my health but the important thing to me is for you to do what i will require you in this regard."
 "As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Security company here in Cote d lvoire. I will also issue a letter of authorization to the Security company  that will prove you the present beneficiary of this money.Note when you will contact the security company on no account should you let them know that the content of the deposit is money because my late husband decleared it to them as containg family values belonging to his foriegn business partner who will come for the withdrawal and termination of the contract with the certificate of the deposit which was issued to my late husband by the security company on the day he made the deposit with them which i will send to you on your confirmation that you can handle this transaction."
 I also want you
church or the organization to always pray for me because the lord is my only shepherd.My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that Wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spiritand Truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any
 delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing another good person
 church
organization for this same purpose.
 Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I Stated herein. Hoping to receive your response immedaitely through my private email account(mariamafo@netscape.net).
 Thanks and Remain blessed in the Lord.
 l remain yours sister in Christ.

In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death
 we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines
 but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. 
 \xa0It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don’t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.
 The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years
 the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner
 and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner
 in respect to the provision of a foreign account
 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague. There after i will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. 
 Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged
 you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name
 your bank account number
 your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted.
 Upon receipt of your reply
 I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for thetransfer. 
 You should contact me on my number (00226-7885 75 97) immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately. 
 Your’s faithfully

 President
Hariri Organization
 Beirut
 Lebanon.
 Dear Friend

 This letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have never met. The message could be strange but real
 if you pay some attention to it. I could have notified you about it at least for the sake of your integrity.
 I am Mrs. Nazek Hariri
 wife of the late Prime Minister of Lebanon
 Mr Rafiq Hariri
 who was assassinated on 14 February 2005
 along with 20 others
near the St. George Hotel in Beirut.In the wake of his assassination on 14 February 2005
 the United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan dispatched a fact-finding mission to investigate the killing. Arriving in Beirut on 25 February
 the mission interviewed Lebanese officials and politicians
 from both the government and opposition
 studied the Lebanese investigation and legal proceedings
 examined the crime scene and collected evidence.
 It also interviewed some Witnesses.The report emphasizes that it is impossible to identify the culprits until the perpetrators have been brought to justice
 but blames the Syrian government
 which it charges with exerting influence that goes beyond the reasonable exercise of cooperative or neighbourly relations
 with primary responsibility for the political tension that preceded the assassination
 by its (interference) with the details of governance in Lebanon in a heavy-handed and inflexible manner.Since the perpetrators of these evil act has not been brought to justice
 l have the feelings that l am not also save here in Beirut.
 "I intend leaving Lebanon for greener pasture.During my husbands regime as the Prime Minister of Lebanon
 He realized some reasonable amount of money from various deals that I successfully executed. The money was deposited by my husband in my name
 Mrs. Nazek Hariri
 in a Finance Firm in Europe. I have plans to invest this money outside Lebanon.I am contacting you because am looking for a trusted and reliable person that will represent me in Europe to claim the money on my behalf."
 I have sent a notification letter to the financier institution
 that the consignment will be collected by the family foreign business partner.Why l need a foreign partner is that
 as an Arab woman
 the tradition forbids me to run any business with my son (Saadeddine). Since he was not aware of the money from the very first beginning.When I receive your positive response I will then give you details of the Finance firm
 and the amount involves.
 Best regards and God bless

 Mrs.Nazek Rafiq Hariri

 ATTENTION: The President / Director

 I know that this message may come to you as a surprise since we do not know each other before
 but for purpose of introduction
 I am Dr I.B Skosana
 the chief Auditor in ABSA BANK of South Africa. 
 During my auditing work in the bank
 I found an account opened in this bank in 1992 and since 2000 nobody has operated on this account. After going through some old files in the record
 I discovered that the owner of this account is Mr. Smith.B. Andreas
 from MUNICH GERMANY and a miner at Kruger Gold Company who died along with his entire family in a plane crash. Since 2000
 No other person(s) knows about this account or any thing concerning it
 the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that his company does not know anything about this account and the amount involved is Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (US$12.5M).
 FOR MORE INFORMATION VISIT THIS SITE BELOW:
 http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm
 I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money cannot be approved to a local bank here
 but can only be approved to any foreign account because the money is in US Dollars and the former owner of the account Mr. Smith B. Andreas is a foreigner too. I need your full co-operation to make this transaction work
 because the management is ready to approve the transfer of this money to any foreigner who has correct information of this account
 which I will provide to you later. If you are able and willing to handle such amount in strict confidence and according to my instructions and advice for our mutual benefit because this is a lifetime opportunity. 
 With my position in the office I can lobby to transfer this money into your account
 with the assurance that the money will be intact pending my physical arrival in your country.
 I will destroy all documents of transaction immediately this money is transferred
 leaving no trace to any place. I will apply for my annual leave to get visa immediately I hear from you that you are ready to act and receive this fund in your account. I will use my position and influence to effect legal approvals and onward transfer of this money to your bank account with appropriate clearance forms from the appropriate ministries and foreign exchange departments. 
 Please reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step to take immediately. Send also your private telephone and fax numbers for easy communications. 
 At the conclusion of this business
 you will get 30% of the total amount
 65% will be for me
 while 5% will be for expenses both parties might incur during the transfer process. 
 I look forward to your earliest reply
 God Bless. 
 Sincerely Yours

 RE:TRANSFER OF (USD 18.6 MILLION)
 In order to transfer out (USD 18.6 MILLION) United States Dollars) from ECOBANK .I have the courage to ask for your assistance to handle this important and confidential business believing that you will never let me down either now or in future.
 I am Mr Desmond Koffi 
 the manager of ECO-BANK here in dakar senegal. there is an account opened in this bank in 1982 and since 2001 nobody has operated on this account again. After going through some old files in the records
 I discovered that if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing.
 The owner of this account is a foreigner
 and he was a miner at CIVOTT GOLD MINNING SARL. and he was a Geologist by profession and he died since 1992. No other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it
 the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that this company does not know anything about this account and the amount involved is (USD 18.6 M) United States Dollars).
 "I want to transfer the [USD18.6 M] United States Dollars into a safe foreigners partner abroad 
 but I dont know any foreigner
 I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to any africa person here
 but can only be approved to any foreign person because the money is in us dollars and the former owner of the account is a foreigner too.I know that this message will come to you as a surprise as we dont know ourselves before
but besure that it is real and a genuine business."
 You are the only person that I have contacted in this business
 so please reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step to take urgently. Send also your private telephone and fax number . I want us to meet face to face or sign a binding agreement to bind us together so that you can receive this money in your country in cash through our diplomat that we used to air lift funds to shell and chevron oil companies in europe and america. I will fly to your country for withdrawal and sharing and other investments after you have confirmed the money in to your account

 I am contacting you because of the need to involve a foreigner with foreign foreign address as beneficiary. I need your full co-operation to make this work fine because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this fund
 which I will give to you later immediately
 if you are able and with capability to handle such amount in strict confidence and trust according to my instructions and advice for our mutual benefit because this opportunity will never come again in my life.
 "I need truthful person in this business because I dont want to make mistake I need your strong assurance and trust. With my position now in the office I can transfer this money to any foreigners reliable person

Dear Friend

 I am Rev.Fr. Peter Clark
 a senior staff with the UN special duties office ;my office monitors and controls the affairs of all banks and financial institutions. I have before me list of funds
 which could not be transferred to some nominated accounts as these accounts have been identified either as ghost accounts
 unclaimed deposits or over-invoiced sum etc. I have the opportunity to write you based on the instructions among others i received days ago from the officer in the computer section in person of Engineer Peter Cliff
to bring out part of your total pending payment with reference number (LM-05-371) amounting US$10million. The (Ten Million Dollars) is arranged in a security-proof box weighing 75kg. In order to get the box shipped to you.
 A lot of people are interested in your payment and those people are merely doing paper works with you and that explains why you receive different kinds of untrue fax and phone messages from different people everyday. As I found out that you have almost met all the statutory requirements in respect of your pending payment. Also we found out that some of the officials of the parastatals have been extorting money from you with the pretext of helping you receive your money. I can assure you this will keep happening if you do not do away with those officers.I am the final signatory to any transfer or remittance of huge funds moving within banks both on the local and international levels.
 A friend of mine who is a diplomat disclosed to me that there is a security courier service company that is specialised in sending diplomatic materials and information from one country to another
 with diplomatic immunity and consignment such as this cannot be checked by any customs anywhere in the world unlike Dhl
 Ems
 FedEx and Ups because
 they will have to open the box for inspection by the customs before shipment. This is what we want to avoid because this box is been padded with synthetic nylon and to open it you will have to cut the pad before you will meet the button that you will press to open the dial code-lock. There is no way you can open the box and be able to close it again because it was padded with machine. I have therefore met the official of the security courier service and concluded shipping arrangement with them
 which they will commence as soon as I have your go ahead order. The diplomat will bring the consignment to you
 he has been!
   in this line of work for many years now ;so you have notting to worry about.
 I am conditionally prepared to assist you get the money
 practically after studying the part leading to this particular stage in the payment process in connivance with your local collaborators to conceal the authentic source of the funds.And my only condition for this unusual assistance is after all arrangements we have concluded that you must donate Five Hundred Thousand United States dollars (US$500
000.00) to any charity organisation I designate as soon as you receive your money. To this effect
 you will send to us a promissory note for the donation along with your address where you will like the box to be delivered to by courier. May almighty God bless you
 Please maintain topmost secrecy as it may cause a lot of problems if found out that we are using this way to help you. You are advised not inform anyone about this until you received your money. When you conclude this we will help to ship the final part of your money to you. Feel free to call!
   me on my private telephone number above for further discussion. Henceforth
 write me on this my private email address below.

Dear Sir.
 My name is Olufemi Cole. I want to use this medium after going through your profile to seek for your assistance in a business transaction which is of mutual benefit.
 A foreigner named late Mr. Mike Tsuji who was an Oil Merchant/Contractor with the Shell Petroleum Development Company until his death in an ill fated plane crash UTA Flight 141 on Thursday 25th December
 2003 in Cotonou along the coast of West Africa
 had a balance of USD$27.5million with Union Bank and the bank now expects any of his available next of kin to claim.
 To this regard
 I am contacting you being the lawyer to the deceased as I have been directed by the Board of Trustees of the deceased bank to look for the deceased next of kin
 which I have done and found out that he has no next of kin which means that these funds will be lost to the government.
 In order to avert this development
 I seek your indulgence to have you stand as the deceased next of kin so that the funds will be subsequently transferred and paid into your foreign account. On indicating your interest
 all documents and proofs to enable you get this funds will be carefully worked out and we are assuring you a 100% risk free transaction. You will be allowed to retain 40% of the total amount after the transaction. If this proposal is okay by you
 and you wish to take advantage of the trust bestowed on you
 kindly contact me with this e-mail address(<a shape="rect" href="mailto:olufemicole@walla.com">olufemicole@walla.com</a>) to enable me furnish you with relevant details to this transaction.
 Your telephone number and Fax number would be necessary for effective communication.
 Best regards

 Olufemi Cole.(Esq.)

My name is Mr. Fredrick Andrew. I trained and work as an external auditor for the Development Bank of
 Singapore (DBS) of Singapore. I have taken pains to find your contact through personal endeavours because
 a late investor
who bears the same last name with you has left monies totaling a little over $10 million
 United States Dollars with Our Bank for the past twelve years and no next of kin has come forward all
 these years.
 Banking regulation legislation in Singapore demand that I notify the fiscal authorities after a statutory
 time period of twelve years when dormant accounts of this type are called in by the monetary regulatory
 bodies. The above set of facts underscores my reason of writing.I am of the settled conviction that using
 my insider leverage
 working with you
since you have the same last Name with the Late Investor
 we can
 secure the funds in the account for us instead of allowing it pass as unclaimed funds into the coffers
 of the Government of Singapore. This exactly is why I
 crave your participation and cooperation.
 I have seized all relevant information (legal and Banking) that will facilitate our putting you forward
 as the claimant/beneficiary of the funds and ultimately transfer the money to any account nominated
 risk . Needless to say
 Uttermost CONFIDENTIALITY is of vital importance if we are to successfully reap the
 immense benefits of this transaction. I have intentionally left out the finer details for now until
 I hear from you. To affirm your willingness and cooperation to my proposal please do so by email

 stating your full names

 response.

 Thank you for the attention being given to go through my message. Before I proceed
 I humbly introduce myself to your goodself. My name is Mrs Amina Dhari Ali al-Fayadh

 undergoing medical treatment here in Thailand. My late husband was until recently
 Shiite Member of Parliament and National Assembly legislator until his assassination in 2005.
 When my husband and my son including two of his bodyguards was killed during the crisis
 I and my last Son escaped to Iran with the help of United Nations officials from there we came to Thailand.
 I know that this mail will come to you as a surprise but honestly I do not intend to surprise you. I write this letter in respect of my intention to invest the sum of USD$10Million with your company which we inherited from my late husband. The fund was originally gotten from my late husband proceeds through the duration of his stay in goverment.
 My late husband was able to safe guard the fund with a very good diplomatic means from my Country to Thailand for safety because of the situation that led to crisis going on in my country. Presently
 this money is still under safekeeping with the International diplomatic firm here in Thailand.
 I have decided to contact you because I am interested in investing this fund in your country which is investment friendly. Please kindly guide and assist me in making the right investment since I am also interested in buying a residential property as I will be moving with my son over there as soon as every thing regarding technical and logictics details is worked out and ascertained to our respective satisfaction.
 In view of your participation
I am ready to give you a good negotiable percentage for your assistance
or better still commit it into viable Joint venture projects
be assured that you stand no risk of any kind as the funds belong to me and my only survived son. As soon as I get your consent
 we will quickly move this fund to your country for investment .
 Please note: we will need your assistance and support is making sure the said fund is successfully transffered to your country without any hitch
 and do understand that there is no risk of any kind involve in this as you will confirm
 all that we require of you is your reliability and trustworthiness. Being in exile is not easy at my age
 coupled with my ill health due to the trauma from what I have been through.
 I am here with my Son Rashidi. I strongly believe that associating with you to embark on this and other business venture will derive a huge success hereafter. However
 upon your acceptance to work as my partner
 you can contact me with my private telephone number or e-mail for more details and the steps we shall take to finalize on the project.
 I await to hearing from you soonest.

FROM MR ABDUL LAZEEZ
 STANDARD TRUST BANK OF BENIN
 REPUBLIC OF BENIN. 
 WEST AFRICA.
 DEAR FRIEND
 \xa0 I am MR ABDUL LAZEEZ
 the director in charge of auditing and accounting section of Standard trust bank of Benin cotonou Republic of Benin in West Africa with due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction . 
 During our investigation and auditing in this bank
my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in (beirut-bound charter jet) plane crash on the 25th December 2003 here in cotonou (replublic of benin) and since his untimely death the funds has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development.You shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site which I got during my investigation; (<a shape="rect" href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/12/26/benin.crash/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/12/26/benin.crash/index.html</a>). 
 Although personally
 I keep this information secret within myself and partners to enable the whole plans and idea be Profitable and successful during the time of execution. The said amount was US$24.1M(Twenty Four million One
 Hundred Thousand united states dollars). 
 As it may interest you to know
 I got your impressive information through a friends who works with the Ministry of Information here in Cotonou-Benin. 
 It is him who recommended your person to me to be viable and capable to champion a business of such magnitude without any problem .Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased
get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit yourself to this great business opportunity. 
 In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant
we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank.
 This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designated bank account. 
 May I at this point emphasize that this transaction is 100% risk free as I have made arrangements for a successful arrangement as an insider of the bank before contacting you. On smooth conclusion of this transaction
 you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification
 while 10% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone bills
 while 60% will be for me and my partners. 
 Please
 you have been adviced to keep this a top secret as we are still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. 
 I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment
 either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in. 
 All other necessary information will be sent to you on your acceptance to champion this transaction with me. 
 I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible on my personal email address stating your wish in this deal. 
 Yours faithfully
 
 Mr ABDUL LAZEEZ

My name is Mrs. Catherine O‘Connor. I trained and work as an external auditor for the International Financial Services Ltd for Anglo Irish Bank. Working as part of a bigger team that covers the entire Republic of Ireland region. I have taken pains to find your contact through personal endeavours.
 On routine audit check last month
 I discovered some investment accounts that has been dormant for the last twelve(12) years. All the accounts belonging to a single holder with monies totalling a little above ($17.1 Million United States Dollars) plus interest. Banking regulation/legislation in Ireland demand that I notify the fiscal authorities after a statutory time period of twelve years when dormant accounts of this type are called in by the monetary regulatory bodies. The above set of facts underscores my reason of writing and making the following proposal.
 My investigations of the said account reveals that the investor died in 1993—the exact time the account was last operated
 I can confirm with certainty that the said investor died interstate and no next–of–kin to his estate has been found or has come forward all these years.
 I am of the settled conviction that using my insider leverage
 I
 working with you can secure the funds in the account for us instead of allowing it pass as an unclaimed funds into the coffers of the Irish Government. This is especially possible as you bear the same LAST NAME to the said investor
 and can stand as his extended relative. This exactly is why I crave your participation and co-operation.
 I have seized all relevant documents (Legal and Banking) that will facilitate our putting you forward as the claimant/beneficiary of the funds and ultimately transfer the money to any account nominated by you. Of course you shall be handsomely rewarded for your part in this transaction as the people I am working with have agreed to allocate a 30% of the total funds for your efforts
 less any expenses.
 I shall however leave out the finer details of this transaction till I receive an affirmation of your desire to participate.
 Be assured that me and my colleagues are on top of the situation. There will be no risk involved whatsoever if you agree to come on board. Needless to say
 UTMOST CONFIDENTIALITY is of vital importance if we are to successfully reap the immense benefits of this transaction.
 To maintain the level of security required to see this transaction come to a successful conclusion
 I have intentionally left out the finer details.
 To affirm your willingness and cooperation to my proposal please contact me through email
 telephone/fax stating the followings for my confirmation:
 Your prompt response will be highly appreciated.
 Thank you

 my client

 Wife of a farmer engineer
Engineer Hessen Halzeinger until his death three years ago in a ghastly motor accident with her adopted Baby along Sagamu Expressway
Accra
Ghana. Since then I have made several inquiries to Several Embassies to locate any of my clients extended relatives
 this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts
 I decided to trace his relatives over the Internet
 to locate any member of his Husabad family but of no avail. Then I have to contact you to assist me in repatriating the money left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the Bank where this huge deposits were lodged. Particularly
 the Bank where the deceased had an account valued at about US$10.5Million has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin
relatives so that the fund left will be transferred or have the account confiscated within the next twenty official working days. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 3 years now I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to the deceased so that the proceeds of this account valued at US$10.5Million can be paid to you and then you and I can share this money. 50% to me and 40% to you
while 10% should be for expenses or tax as your Government may require. All I require is your honest and co-operation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. I will want you to send to me on your return email the following information for the transfer in your favour.

Good day and God bless

 Greetings to you in the name of God Almighty. I am former Mrs. Memunat Farouk Hasan
 now I am Mrs. Rebecca Farouk Hasan a widow to Late Farouk Hasan Muhammad.
 I am an old woman; suffering from cancer. From all indications
 my condition is really deteriorating and is quite obvious that I may not live long
 because the cancer stage has gotten to a very severe stage. My late husband died in an air crash on the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline Boeing 990 with other passengers on board. You can confirm this fact from the website which was aired by the BBC WORLD NEWS:(http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm) and my only daughter died in BOMB ATTACK LONDON.
 My late husband was very wealthy and after his death
 I inherited all his business and wealth. My personal physician told me that I may not live for so long and I am so scared about this. So
 I now decided to divide part of this wealth
 by contributing to the well being of less privileged people and handicapped in the society of world America
 Canada
 Africa
 Europe and Asian Countries.
 This mission
 who will no doubt be tasking had made me to recently
 relocate to Africa where I live presently. I selected you for this Purpose and prayed over it
 I am willing to donate the sum of $7
300
000.00 Million US Dollars to you for the development of the well being of handicapped in the society and also as aids for the less privileged around your country
 and i have map out $1
700.000.00 for your own personal use to help me for this work. 
 Please note that
 this fund is lying in a Security Bank. Therefore immediate application for the transfer of the money in your name or your home. Please
 do not reply me if you have the intention of using this fund for personal use
 than enhancement of the comfort of the Handicapped.
 "Lastly
 I want you/your home to be praying for me as regards my entire life and my health because I have come to find out since my spiritual birth lately that wealth acquisition without God ones life is vanity upon vanity."
 I await your reply.

 NOTIFICATION OF BEQUEST.
 Dear Sir

 On behalf of the Trustees and Executor of the Estate of Late Mr. Edwin Gabriel
 I once again try to notify you as my earlier letter were returned undelivered.
 I hereby
 attempted to reach you again by this same email address on the WILL but could not yet go through hence I decided to reach you by email probably if you could receive it this time.
 May
 I notify you that late Mr. Edwin Gabriel made you a beneficiary to his WILL. Hence
 he left the sum of Nine Million One Hundred Thousand Dollars (USD$9
100.000.00) to you in the codicil and last testament to his will.
 This may sound strange and unbelievable to you
 but it is real and true. Being a widely raveled man
 he must have been in contact with you in the past or simply you were nominated to him by one of his numerous friends abroad who wished you good.
 Mr. Edwin Gabriel until his death was a member of the Helicopter Society and the Institute of Electronic &amp; Electrical Engineers. He was a very dedicated Christian and he also loves Muslim brothers who loved to give out. His great philanthropy earned him numerous awards during his lifetime. Late Mr. Edwin Gabriel died on the 16th day of February 2005 at the age of 90 years
 and his WILL is now ready for execution.
 According to him
 this money is to support your Christian activities and to help the poor and the needy
 as I have made an arrangement with a diplomat
 attached to my Office
 to help you deliver this fund directly at your doorstep
 since transferring the fund through bank-to-bank transfer might demand for a lot of money which you have spent and almost gone bankrupt
 yet
 to no avail.
 Please if I reach you as I am hopeful
 endeavor to get back to me as soon as possible to enable me conclude my job
 as I hope to hear from you in no distant time.
 Yours in His service!

I am pleased to introduce a business opportunity to you
to transfer to your overseas account
sum of($4
123.000.00 USD) Four million one hundred and twenty three thousand United States Dollars) from one of the Prime Banks here in Dakar-Senegal
I urgently want to know soonest you
If you are not capable to handle and acomodate this magnitude of funds untill i resign and come over to join for an investment in your country
tell me so that i can quietly look for another reliable and honest individual that would be capable and fit enough to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this funds
even an empty a/c can serve to receive this funds
as long as you will remain honest to me till we actualise this interest believing that you will never let me down either now or in future.
 I am Mr.Aziz Mohammed the Auditor General of one of the prime banks here in Dakar Senegal west Africa during the course of our auditing
I discovered a floating fund in an account opened in the our bank since 1982 and till date no body has operated on this account again after going through some old files in the records I discovered that the owner of the account died long ago in a plane crash along with his family without leaving a[Heir/WILL] hence the funds is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing.The owner of this account is Khalifa T.Ibrahim a foreigner before his death
he was a management consultant and he died since 1992.No other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it
the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that until his sudden death he was a management consultant.
 Since I hardly know any foreigner
I am only contacting you as a foreigner tp stand and apply as his next of kin because this money can not be approved to a local person here as his next of kin without valid international foreign passport
but can only be approved to any foreigner with valid international passport or drivers license and foreign a/c because the money is in US dollars and the former owner of the a/c is a foreigner too
and the money can only be approved into a foreign a/c. I need your full co-operation to make this work fine because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account
which I will give to you upon your positive response and once I am convinced that you are capable and will meet up with instruction of a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in this business.
 "I need your strong assurance that you will never
never let me down.With my influence and my position in the bank the bank official can transfer this money to any foreigners reliable account that you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending on my physical arrival in your country for sharing. The bank official Will destroy all documents of transaction immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any place and to build confidence you can call me for heart to heart discussion through my private satellite phone which I secured for the security and safety of this business as you know that this business is confidential. At the conclusion of this business
you will be given 40% of the total amount
55% will be for me
 while 5% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during the process of transferring. Call  Me Immediately you recieve this mail : 00-221-559-0212"

This letter must come to you as a big surprise
 but I believe it is only a day that people meet and become great friends and business partners. I am Mr. Majid Al-Hussein
 currently Chief Security Officer with a reputable security and finance company here in U. A. E. I write you this proposal in good faith
 believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.
 On November 10
 1999
 an Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the CHEVRON PETROLEUM CORPORATION
 Mr. Ahmed Haruna made a deposit of a trunk box in my company depository vault as family valuables
 unknowingly that the content of the trunk box were funds valued at US$17
500
000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only) in our company. This was my recent discovery that prompted me to take this very step of looking for someone to claim the funds with before it will get confiscated.
 Upon maturity in 2003
as the Chief security officer
 it is my duty to notify him on the maturity date so I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but the letter was returned undelivered. After sometime
 I tried sending back the letter
 but it was again returned and finally I discovered from his contract employers
 Chevron Petroleum Corporation that Mr.Ahmed Haruna died as a result of torture in the hand of Saddam Hussein (former Iraqi President) during one of his trips to his country Iraq
 as he was accused of leaking information to the Americans. On further investigation
 I discovered that Mr. Ahmed Haruna’s family wife and two sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he did not declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents
 including his Deposit paperwork in my Company and did not leave any WILL. This deposited trunk have been lying in our vault since the date of deposit
 and the management have decided to term it abandoned deposit and this will result confiscating it by our government since no one have heard from the owner since 2003.
 I wish to let you know that all the investigation I have made so far
 my company management is not aware of it
 I am the only one that have the information.
 As the Chief security Officer in my Company
 I have the power to influence the release of the deposit to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account
 with the correct information concerning the account
 which I shall give you. All documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully worked out and there is practically no risk involved
 the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law
 If you accept to work with me
 I want you to state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage
 so that both parties will be satisfied. If you are interested
 contact me as soon as you receive this message so we can go over the details.
 Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. Please
 treat with utmost confidentiality. I shall send you copy of the deposit certificate issued to Mr. Ahmed Haruna when the deposit was made for your perusal. I wait your urgent response.
 Regards

 Mr.Majid Al-Husain

I have been selling my art for the last 3 years and have had my work featured on trading cards
 prints and in magazines
I have sold in galleries and to private
 "collectors from all around the world. I am always facing serious difficulties when it comes to selling my art works in your country
they are always offering to pay with MONEY ORDER OR CASHERS CHEUQES
which is difficult for me to cash here in London United Kingdom."
 "I am looking for a representative in your country who will be working for me as a partime worker and i will be willing to pay 10% for every transaction
which wouldnt affect your present state of work
 someone who would help me recieve payments from my customers in your country
i mean someone that is responsible and reliable
because the cost of coming to your country and getting payments is very expensive
i am working on setting up a branch in your country
so for now i need a representative in your country who will be handling the payment aspect for our company."
 "These payments are in money order or cashers cheuqes and they would come to you in your name if you are willing to assist as a representative
 so all you need to do is cash the money order
 deduct your percentage and Western Union"

 Dear Partner

 Do accept my sincere apologies if my mail does not meet your personal ethics.  For i know this may seem like a complete intrusion to your privacy but right about now this is my option of communication. This note might seem strange or probably untrue considering the amount of junk mails we receive daily
 but i believe this is still the most genuine way of contacting a true character. 
 I will introduce myself as the Head of Foreign Operations Department in the accounts management section this well-known bank here in the United Kingdom as Stated above. I am seeking your cooperation to present you to my bank as the Next of kin to LATE ANDREA SCHRANNER. A Germany property Magnate Andreas Schranner
 64
 his wife Maria
 62
 their daughter Andrea Eich
 38
 her husband Christian
 57
 and their children Katharina
 eight
 and Maximilian
 10
 all perished in the jet.
 Please click here below for verification. 
 PROPOSITION:
 "One of late Andrea Schranners accounts with holding balance of £15
000
000(Fifteen Million British Pounds) has been dormant and has not been operated for the past 5 years and the DEPOSIT will be converted to UNCLAIMED  DEPOSIT and therefore forfeited if nobody comes forward to lay claim to the deposit before the end of this financial quarter
 as is the practice and also indicated in the EU banking guidelines."
 "&gt;From my investigations and confirmation
 the owner of this account a foreigner by name Late Andrea Schranners died on MONDAY
 31 JULY
2000 in a plane crash with his family."
 After going through the deceased records and files
 I discovered that: 
 (3) No other person knows about this account and there was no known beneficiary. 
 And if we do not remit this money urgently
 it would be confiscated and forfeited for nothing. I have secretly discussed this matter with account officer and we have agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal with. We thus propose to do business with you
 standing in as the next of kin of these funds from the deceased and funds released to you after due processes have been followed. 
 This transaction is totally free of risk and troubles as the fund is a legitimate and does not originate from drug
 money laundering
 terrorism or any other illegal act. On your interest
 let me hear from you.
 "On your interest
 let me have your private/direct contact numbers including fax and a copy of your International Passport or drivers license for easy communication
 identification and trust. I must be reached only on my private contact details for confidential reasons."

 Dear Stef Brown

 "I know this mail may come to you as a surprise.Nevertheless please dont be
I am Mrs.Piloma Kortie
 aged 59 years
 the wife of Major Moussa Kortie
 Chief Security Officer and Aide-de–camp to the exiled president Charles Taylor of Liberia."
 As a result of the on-going crisis in my country
 I am saddled with problems of my ill-health (protracted diabetes and high blood pressure) which is currently of increase in the recent time but more importantly to me now is getting a trust worthy individual abroad to receive the sum of US$3 million and 3.65kg of Diamond on our behalf
 this
I intend to invest in your country.
 Due to the present crisis in my home city Monrovia
 I managed to sneak away with my son Larry
23 years of age and my only daughter
Fannte
 26 years
 out from Monrovia to Dakar-Senegal for our safety. We sneaked into Dakar-Senegal through the land boarder by the help of some government militia group who guarded our safe exit from Liberia.
 "After the killing of my husband by the rebels
 we decided to come down here to Dakar senegal to take a temporal assylum and also to secure the this deposit as was made here by my late husband also
 to further look for a trust worthy person abroad to receive these deposit upon its release.My late husband made this deposit before he was eventually killed in my presence by the heartless rebels when they invaded our residence in Monrovia."
 I feel confident therefore to introduce myself to you based on this problem and our present condition of stay here since all our foreign contacts and connections got lost as result of the crisis which lead to the killing of my late husband and the destruction of all his other properties and estates by the rebels.I am desperately in need to move and re-locate this deposit to your country for safe keeping as this is the only wealth remaining for the future survival and well being of me and my family out of all my late husbands estates/ properties.
 For your assistance
 a negotiable percentage shall be discussed with you as I receive your positive response on this issue
our lives are in danger due to our present state of insecurity and condition of our stay here.I plead and look foward for your help.
 Please endavour to email me back for further clarifications on this issue.
 God bless you as you respond to my plea this number 00221-486-5911 for assistance.
 Sincerely yours.
 Mrs Piloma Kortie.

Before I introduce myself
 I wish to inform you that this letter is not a hoax mail and I urge you to treat it serious. We want to transfer to an oversea account ($16
700.000.00 USD) Sixteen Million Seven Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) from one of the banks located in Euroupe. I want to ask you
 If you are not capable to quietly look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this money
 even an empty a/c can serve to receive this money
 as long as you will remain honest to me till the end of this important business 
I am trusting in you and believing in God that you will never let me down either now or in future.
 "I am mr Edward Nkanga a personal assiatant to late Andreas Schranner. During the course of his banks last week auditing
it was discovered that since his death no one has come forward to lay claim to this funds.So the bank issued me a memo to provide his next of kin or forfeith the funds. This account was opened with the bank in 1999 and since 2000 nobody has operated on this account again
 after going through some old files in my records
I discovered that my late client  died without a [Heir/WILL] hence the money is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing."
 The owner of this account Mr. Andreas Schranner a German property magnate who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of AF4590 German Concorde which crahsed on July 25th 2000
including his family leaving nobody as next of kin.
 No other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it
the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that the account is a secret account.
 "The total amount involved is Sixteen million Seven Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only [$16
700.000.00] and we wish to transfer this money into a safe foreigners account abroad. But I dont know any foreigner
 I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local person here
 but to a foreigner who has information about the account
 which I shall give to you upon your positive response. I am revealing this to you with believe in God that you will never let me down in this business
 you are the first and the only person that I am contacting for this business
 so please reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step to take urgently."
 At the conclusion of this business
 you will be given 25% of the total amount
70% will be for us
 while 5% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during the process of transferring. I look forward to your earliest reply. PLEASE
 TREAT THIS PROPOSAL AS TOP SECRET.
 Best Regards

 Edward Nkanga

 Dear Kathleen Crain
 
 I am Zhang He
 Bank Manager of the Bank of China
 Shenzhen branch
 China. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. 
 On June 7
 2000
 a consultant/ contractor with the Chinese Solid Minerals Corporation
 made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months
 valued at Twenty One Million Dollars (US$21
000
000.00) only in my branch. Upon maturity
 I sent a routine notification to the forwarding address but got no reply. After a month
 we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers
 the South Korea Solid Minerals Corporation that he died along with his wife from a plane crash. On further investigation
 I found out that he died Without making a WILL
 and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. 
 I therefore made further investigation and discovered that he did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents
 including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. 
 This sum of US$21
000
000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. 
 According to Laws of China
 at the expiration of eight (8) years
 the money will revert to the ownership of the South Korea Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. 
 Consequently
 my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to assist me in receiving this money as I have every machinery set to enable you receiver this money via a Finance firm based overseas. 
 I need your urgent assistance so that this money will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple
 I will require you to send me your complete names
 contact address and telephone and fax numbers so that I will be able to apply for the necessary documents to enable you receive the money via the Finance firm overseas in your name. After receiving the money
 we will share in the ratio of 75% for me and 25% for you. Note that the project will be 100% risk free. Considering my position as the credit officer of the bank
 I guarantee the successful execution of this transaction. I have the facilities to obtain relevant documents to enable me lift the money from the bank overseas. 
 If you are interested
 please reply immediately. Upon your response
 I will then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. 
 I will also let you have the contact details of the Finance Firm and the country it is located in Overseas. Please send me your confidential TELEPHONE and FAX Numbers for fast communication
 as I will need to speak to you to personally. You should observe utmost confidentiality
 and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us. Awaiting your urgent reply. 
 Thanks and regards. 
 Zhang He.

Naturally
 this letter will come to you as a surprise since we have not met
 permit me however
 I am Mr. Alan Jack a Zimbabwean Farmer.
 I am contacting you as the need for me to have a foreign partner in your country has become necessary due to my plans to relocate and establish a private company in that region
 as the present political instability in my country (Zimbabwe)
 does not encourage financial investment as the environment is not conducive for investment and most of all security is not guaranteed
 just as reported by the International media.
 "This problem started when the Zimbabwean government under the leadership of President Robert Mugabe announced a decree on May 31st 2001 to seize more than 6000 white-owned farms. So far
 more than 5
400 white owned farms have been invaded
 properties confiscated and farm lands seized. During these periods
 as reported by the international media and C.N.N
 more than 500 white farmers were killed; the government didnt stop at this
 as just recently the government has asked all white-farmers to give up their farms to black farmers or risk going to prison. Having lived in this country (Zimbabwe) for more than 35 years
 I have no other country to go to
 nor can I trace any of my distant relatives."
 Therefore
 I decided to contact you through my local Zimbabwean associate (Mr. Dennis Udongo) for your assistance so that I can establish a company in your country and relocate there. Also
 I must re-iterate the importance of having a citizen of your country to front as the owner of the enterprise
 due to the fact that I will be a foreigner in your country. For this purpose
 I have deposited in a Security Company based in Amsterdam (Holland) all the funds realized from the sales of my farmland and other farming equipment which amounted to USD18
 500
000.00 (Eighteen million
 five hundred United States Dollars). These funds was packaged in two metal boxes and declared as personal effects and photographic materials so as to avoid detection by immigration/security officials. For now
 I stay in Asia
 because Zimbabwe is highly unsafe for me and my family. Upon your immediate response
 I will immediately arrange and send to you all the documentation that will empower your good self in finalizing the transaction with the Security Company in UAE Dubai.
 Let me use this opportunity to also inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free and genuine and should also be handled in the most confidential manner. This proposal is NOT and must NOT be linked to all the numerous SCAM letters flying around the internet world today. The money (USD18.5m) already stashed in the two boxes could be termed as consignment and I will not hesitate to link you to my safe contact in the security company for further discussion. Lest I forget
 you should be entitled to 30% of the total funds for your support and cooperation in the transaction. It’s also your duty to assist me in investing my own share of the money in your company or in your country. I shall be counting on your unalloyed trust and immediate response.
 Best Regards and God bless.

 Mrs.Amina Hassan.

I feel very sorry to interrupt your peace since you are not expecting to receive any mail from me.However
I was obliged to do so due to the importance and urgency of the massage.I crave your indulgence
and want to reassure you that I mean well and that it is only for our mutual good.So please do not be embbarrassed or suspicious.
 I am Col
 Kobia Abuom
 I got to know you courtesy of international business bureau here in ( Thailand)Sequel to my zeal towards foreign investment and also security for my life and my possession
 I therefore write to give you a Breakdown of this proposal .
 "I was the personal confidant to the first vice-president
 Dr John Garang of Southern Sudan whose death was a deep sadness by popular demand of the citizens of Southern Sudans as a result of helicopter crash.Dr. Garangs demise is a tragedy of enormous proportions. His death is a huge loss not only to the people of Sudan but to the people of Eastern Africa and the continent as a whole."
 I will be 38years this year and out of this years
 16 years was spent in the bush fighting as a Guerilla. All these years my total devotion was to the late Vice president.Eventually we succeeded in over- running Sudan Peoples Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A). I was handsomely rewarded with the position of personal confidant of the president. Aside being his Chief Security officer
 was also charged with the responsibility of ensuring steady purchase and supply of arms from North Korea.
 A week before the death of the Vice president I was in North Korea with a total sum of US$39 million dollars cash(Thirty Nine Million US Dollars) which was brought in through a diplomatic means.This money was to effect the payment of shipment of long-range anti-tanker launchers to my country before I learnt of the sudden death of the Vice president. My initial reaction was to deposit this money with a Security Company in North Korea
due to security reasons i diverted the treasure containing the fund to Thailand through a diplomatic means.On arrival here I immediately deposited the treasure into a Private Security /finance company for safe keeping although the Security Company and the diplomat who assisted me to Thailand is unaware of the contents as they were deposited as privileged consignments.
 Right now
 I am seeking for a partner who shall serve as the guardian/overseer of this fund with whom I can plan the best way to move this money for investment purposes
 which is my motive for contacting you.
 To be able to actualize this project
 you are required to assist in the following manners.
 (1) That you shall serve as the general overseer and guardian of this fund and all investment thereafter.
 (2) To assist in providing me and my immediate family permanent residential permit in your country after the money must have been transferred to your account.
 For these services
 a suitable percentage (%) will be mapped out for you after you have shown your willingness to assist
 and most importantly all expenses involved in this transaction will be taken care of when the money have been safely transferred to your designated account.
 In addition 
 there would be a face to face meeting here in Bangkok Thailand for further discussions and to consummate the transaction at once. I will give you all the details in my next mail when you have indicated your interest and commitment to work with me.
 Always remember that this is the highest confidence and trust any person can repose on the other
 especially when it is considered that we did not know ourselves before. I hope you will honor me too.
 NOTE: I know there may be scams and junk mails flying here and there on the internet but certainly
 this is not one of them.
 Now I urge you to take this message seriously and with an open mind
 with good faith and trust. Join me and I am assuring you now that you will never be disappointed. I expect to receive your response soonest I do not intend to have this transaction delayed. Please treat this as highly confidential by keeping it only with yourself.
 I look forward to your urgent co-operation.
 Best regards

 Col Kobia Abuom.

from the Republic of Cote D Ivoire.\xa0 I am the only son of late Mr and Mrs .Jean Claude Messou
 a wealthy cocoa farmer before he was poisoned to death by his associates on one of their outings to discuss a business.
 \xa0 Mother died earlier in 2001 so my father took me so special being his only son.\xa0\xa0 I have a proposition that I am making to you and I know that by the Grace of God you will not disappoint me.
 \xa0 Before the death of my Father in June
2004 in a pivate hospital here in Abidjan
he told me in his sick bed that he deposited the sum of $6.5 millions\xa0\xa0 (Six Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in a Term Deposit Account\xa0 with a Bank here for onward transfer abroad for Investment.
 should look for an honest\xa0 Investor who can help me transfer and invest this money abroad.\xa0 He feared that those who killed him may equally not like to see me alive.
 \xa0 I have been thinking about this for sometime now so that is why I am\xa0 writing you to see if you can help me provide your Account where this\xa0 money will be transferred and also help me look for investment prospects in your Country.
 \xa0 I dont have any idea how this is done so I will like to do all the\xa0 process until the money is transferred into your account. I am willing to conceed (15%) percent of this amount to you for your assistance and the rest
minus (5%) percent for any expenses that may come\xa0 up
will go for the investment.
 \xa0 I have not told anybody about this except you so I would please ask\xa0 you to keep this 
 strictly to your self for my personal safety. If this is okay by you
you can please\xa0\xa0 send me an email through this mailbox.
 \xa0 Thank you and anticipating to hear from you.
 \xa0 Yours sincerely

I am Mr MAXWELL TAMBO
 Bank Manager of a Reputable bank in Johannesburg
 Gauteng Province
 and Republic of South Africa. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.On feb 27
 2001
 a British Oil Consultant/contractor with the South African Mining Corporation
 (Name deliberately with held) made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months
 valued at US$50
000
000.00 (Ffity Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity
 I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.
 "After a month
 we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers
 the South African Mining Corporation
 that the depositor died from an automobile accident. On further investigation
 I found out that he died without making a WILL
 and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that  the depositor did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents
US$50
00
000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of Republic of South Africa
at the expiration of 5(five) years
 the money will revert to the ownership of the South African Government if nobody applies to claim the  fund.Consequently
 my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as THE NEXT OF KIN to the depositor so that the fruits of this old mans labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials."
 This is simple
 I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the Necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarisation of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favour for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60%for me and 35% for you and 5% for any expenses that we are going to incue.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested
 please reply immediately via the private email address.Upon your response
 I shall then  provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.
 Please send me your full name
address
 confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication.Also
Please observe utmost confidentiality
 and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.
 Thanks and Regards.

Dear Friend.
 "    I am Rev. Fr.Richard David. A senior staff with the World Bank fact finding &amp; special duties office.I am writing you this letter based on the fact that cool penny is better than millions of dollars means its better for one to live and die poor honest man than a rich dishonest one."
 I and the Chief security officer (CSO) of this organization and have arranged with an officer in the computer section in person of Engineer Joseph Cliff to bring out part of your total pending payment with reference number (LEM-05-371) amounting to US$10 million. Why we did this is because according to information gathered from the Bank’s/security computer
 you have been waiting for a long time to receive this payment without success.
 As I found out that you have almost met all the statutory requirements in respect of your pending payment. The problem we feel you are having is that of interest groups. A lot of people are interested in your payment and those people are merely doing paper works with you and that explains why you receive different kinds of untrue fax and phone messages from different people everyday.
 Also we found out that some of the officials of the prostates have been extorting a lot of money from you with the pretext of helping you receive your money. I can assure you this will keep happening if you do not do away with those officers. For security reasons you do not have to tell anybody that your have your payment on the way until the payment gets to you.
 The said payment is been arranged in a security-proof box weighing 75kg. In order to get this box shipped to you I and the (COS) Yesterday went to this four courier companies DHL
 Ems
 FedEx and Ups to make arrangements on how to get the box shipped to you by courier
 but to no avail the above courier companies all made us to understand that they  have to open the box for inspection by the customs before shipment.
 This is something we want to avoid because this box is been padded with synthetic nylon and to open it you will have to cut the pad before you will meet the button that you will press to open the dial code-lock. There is no way you can open the box and be able to close it again because it was padded with machine.
 We told the courier services that the box contained film materials and when open will spoil the materials. &lt;N:B&gt; we did not declare money because courier does not carry money.Today a friend of mine who is diplomat disclosed to me that there is a security courier service company that is specialized in sending diplomatic materials and information from one country to another
 which also has diplomatic immunity and consignment such as this cannot be checked by any customs anywhere in the world.
 I have therefore met the official of the security courier service and concluded shipping arrangement with them
 which they will commence as soon as I have your go ahead order. The diplomat who will be bring in this consignment to you is an expact and has been in this line of work for many years now so we have Notting to worry about.
 After all arrangements we have concluded that you must donate Five Hundred Thousand United States dollars (US$500
000.00) to any charity organization I designate as soon as you receive your money. To this effect
 you will send to us a promissory note for the donation along with your address where you will like the box to be delivered to by courier.
 Please maintain topmost secrecy as it may cause a lot of problems if found out that we are using this way to help you. You are advised not inform anyone about this until you received your money. Am helping you on this because something in me is tells me that you are an honest person. When you conclude this and you send our promise
 we will help to ship the final part of your money to you.May God be with you as i wait for your response either through Fax or Email:

 Best Regard
 Mr Harrison Compaore.

  I am writing to solicit your\xa0cooperation in executing a very profitable and risk free transaction. I have confidence that you have the ability to execute this business to our benefit and believe that you will not let down the trust and confidence I am willing to repose in you.
 "  I attended a Business seminar here in Côte dIvoire
 While in this seminar
 I was lucky to meet Alhaji Fofanah the owner of one of the largest Agricultural Firm dealing on Life stock ets. Alhaji Fofanah is an accomplished agriculturist who specialise in cattle farms and various other agricultural product for export. He has farm in different countries of West Africa. But above all he is one of the greatest suppliers of cattle
 beef and other dairy products in this part of the world. Due to my relationship with Alhaji Fofanah and on getting to know my profession
 Alhaji Fofanah took me into confidence by informing me about huge amount of money he spends on the purchase of a particular and very important"
  medicine for his cattle. 
   He informed me that he buys this product at the rate of $5
000.00USD per carton
 and that he mostly buys to the excess of 300 cartons. He informed me that he was only asking me to find out if I can also source for him a cheaper supplier considering the recent trend of falls in the general price of beef in the world market which is affecting his business.
   I discussed this business with someone here\xa0and he decided to handle the supply by himself. We carried out a market research and discovered that we could purchase this cattle medicine somewhere cheaper in Europe for $ 3
000.00 USD per carton. We moved to Alhaji Fofanah to make a supply to him at $ 4
800.00 USD per Carton of which he accepted. 
   Owing to my role in the Whole arrangement
 I had an agreement with the man to be receiving 18% of whatever gain is made on each Supply since he is to finance the transaction of which he agreed. But on the 20th August 2005
 when the first supply of 120 cartons
  were made to the Alhaji Fofanah 
The man decided to renegade on our agreement. He refused to give me anything near the agreement we arrived at but gave me only what he termed an offer of appreciation. I decided to overlook this betrayal but since then our relationship has seized to be cordial. He never said anything to me again about Alhaji Fofanah.
   But recently
 I visited Alhaji Fofanah he is requesting for supplies of 250 cartons of these substances following a suspected out break of disease among his cattle in Mali and Guinea. He has requested that these supplies be made before
  the mid August 2006. I convinced him that I can arrange for an international supplier who can supply him at the price of $ 4
600.00 USD per Carton. But that he Alhaji Fofanah or his representative will have to go to Europe and inspect it before lifting the goods. At the moment Alhaji Fofanah is waiting for me or my foreign contact.
 "  If you can handle this project
 please contact me immediately for details on how to go about it and the negotiation on what is to be my commission. I am ready to give you Alhajis contact for your direct conversation with him on the mode of payment method."
   Note: Alhaji Fofanah must not know our purchasing source in Europe or Asia. If not he will not be needing our services anymore. He will also paying advance before we supply him.
   Yours Sincerely

CHINA MERCHANT BANK.
 CENTRAL HONG KONG

 NOTIFICATION AS NEXT OF KIN/BENEFICIARY 
 I am Mr.Joseph Yun
 credit officer of the China Merchant Bank.I have a  concealed business suggestion for 
 man made a numbered fixed  deposit for 18 calendar months
 with a value of Twenty Three Million
Six  
 Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch.
 Upon maturity several notice was sent to him
 even during the war. Again after the war another notification 
 killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit their home. After further investigation it was also discovered 
 that the General did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the  paper work of his bank 
 my bank. So
 Twenty Three Million
Six Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is 
 What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my  country at the expiration three years the funds 
 will revert to the ownership  of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this 
 I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document  that will back you up as the next of 
 Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of 
 kin
the attorney will also file  in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and  letter of 
 There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going to adopt a  legalized method and the attorney 
 will prepare all the necessary  documents.  
 Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning  this issue. Once the funds have 
 and 5%for any  expenses incurred during the course of this operation. Should you be interested please 
 send me your private phone and fax  numbers for easy communication
 you can write me via my private 
 Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.

This letter must come to you as a big surprise
 but I believe it is only a day that people meet and become great friends and business partners.
 I am Mr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN
 currently Head of Corporate affairs with a reputable bank here in Dubai -U. A. E. I write you this proposal in good faith
 believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you.
 I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On November 6
 2000
 an Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the CHEVRON PETROLEUM CORPORATION
 MR. KHALIL AL NASSER made a (Fixed deposit) for 36 calendar months
 valued at US$17
500
000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my bank and I happen to be his account officer before I was moved to my present position recently. Upon maturity in 2003
 as his account officer and as well the bank manger
 it is my duty to notify him on the maturity date so I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but the letter was returned undelivered.
 After sometime
 I tried sending back the letter
 but it was again returned and finally I discovered from his contract employers
 Chevron Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Khalil Al Nasser died as a result of torture in the hand of Saddam Hussein (former Iraqi President) during one of his trips to his country Iraq
 as he was accused of leaking information to the Americans.
 On further investigation
 I discovered that Mr. Al Nasser’s family wife and two sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he did not declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents
 including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did not leave any WILL.
 This sum of US$17
500
000.00 have been floating and placed under dormant/unserviceable account by my bank management since no one have heard from the owner since 2003. I wish to let you know that all the investigation I have made so far
 my bank management is not aware of it
 I am the only one that have the information.
 With the recent change of government in my country and with their efforts to support the United Nations in checkmating terrorism aid in the U. A. E. By end of this year
 the government will pass a new financial control law which will give the government authority to interrogate account owners of above $5
000
000.00 to explain the source of the funds
 making sure it is not for terrorism support. If I do not move this money out of the country immediately
 by end of the year the government will definitely confiscate the money
 because my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain the source of the money.
 I cannot directly transfer out this money without the help of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance. As the Account Officer to late Al Nasser
 coupled with my present position and status in the bank as Head of Retail Banking Group
 I have the power to influence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account
 with the correct information concerning the account
 which I shall give you.
 All documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully worked out and there is practically no risk involved
 the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law
 beside U. A. E is porous and anything goes.
 If you accept to work with me
 I want you to state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage
 so that both parties will be satisfied. If you are interested
 contact me as soon as you receive this message so we can go over the details. Thanking you in advance and may Allah bless you
 Please
 treat with utmost confidentiality. I shall send you copy of the deposit certificate issued to Al Nasser when the deposit was made for your perusal.
 I wait your urgent reply through my private email address: kh_rhmn@yahoo.com.au
 Regards


Do accept my sincere apologies if my mail does not meet
 your personal Ethics. I introduce myself as Mr. Andrew Gama staff in
 the accounts management Section of a well-known bank in South Africa.
 One of our accounts with holding balance of £15
000
000
 (Fifteen Million British Pounds) has been dormant and last operated in
 the past 3 years. From my investigations and confirmations
 the owner
 of this account is a Foreigner by name Gerald Stone died on the 4th of
 January 2002 on a planecrash in Birmingham UK.
 Since then nobody has done anything as regards the claiming of this money as he
 has no family Member who is aware of the existence of either the
 accountn or the Funds.Information from the National Immigration also
 states that he was single on entry into South Africa.
 I have confidentially discussed this issue with some of the bank officials and
 we have agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal with. We
 thus propose to do business with you
 standing in as the next of kin of
 these funds from the deceased and funds released to you after due
 processes have been followed.
 This transaction is totally free of risk and troubles as the fund is Legitimate and
 does not originate from drug
 money laundry
 terrorism or any other Illegal act.

 Guinea . The contractor here-in-after referred as my client was also a Diamond/Gold Merchant.
   He made a numbered time (Fixed) deposit of Twenty five million United States of America Dollars in one of the prime banks here in the state capital of with standing statement/agreement with the bank that all correspondences in respect to the fixed deposit contract must
 " be sent to him through my humble chambers. Upon maturity
 the routine notification was forwarded to me that I dispatched to his forwarding address as usual without a reply. After a month
 I sent a reminder which I received from the bank without any reply again. Finally
 I discovered from my Clients contract employers- Guinean Petroleum Corporation that he died among many others in an auto crash along Labé express road. On further investigations
 I found out that he died without making any WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I also discovered that he did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents
 including his fixed deposit contract with the bank in Conakry Guinea ."
   First
 I am contacting you based on the official letter I just received from his bankers reminding me that Guinean law states that at the expiration of 5(five) years the money will revert to the ownership of the Guinean Government if I do not confirm the next of kin to claim the fund. 
 "  Secondly
 as a foreigner
 to stand in as the next of kin to him so that the fruits of this old mans labour will not go into the hands of some corrupt government officials. Note that this transaction is simple and risk free because I will provide expert legal services that will guarantee the successful execution of this deal. "
   I wish to point out that after the claims
 I would want 20% of this money to be shared among charity organizations
 while the remaining 80% is shared equally between us. Most importantly
 I would also require your assistance towards investing my share in your country or anywhere as you may advice. If you are interested
 please contact me immediately. Upon your response
 I shall provide you with more details and how we shall proceed with the claims. I expect you to observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be profitable for both of us.

  further interactions.

 "Kindly Pardon me if this my letter would be an embarrassment to you for I am Waleed Abdalla Ibrahim Mohamed
 a Sudanese from the town of Kass in Southern Darfur writing you from Birmingham
  (United Kingdom)
 I am presently a Political Refugee in United Kingdom away from my native Country (Sudan)
 where there is a raging and devastating Civil war going on between the Southern Sudan Rebel Forces (Sudan Peoples Liberation Army) and Arab militias (Janjaweed)  supported by the Government Forces loyal of President Umar Hassan al-Bashir. Bashir and his party have controlled the government since he led the military coup on 30 June 1989."
 The Darfur conflict erupted in early 2003. Fighting among various factions has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced more than 2 million
 most escaping to larger towns where they stay in camps for "internally displaced people
" and some crossing the border into Chad
 where they live in refugee camps
 straining local resources. Attacks on civilians during the conflict have been brutal and include burning homes
 killing and rape. There has been signed a Darfur Peace Agreement between some of the parties in Darfur. This agreement is supervised by African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS)
 though the war is still going on. Before the escalation of the war I was a VOLUNTIER SOCIAL WORKER and during my duties one of the local army Commander who was wounded in battle and dying from the wound handed over to me documents showing the sum of Twelve Million United States Dollars (US$12 Million) sent overseas mainly for purchasing foods
 pharmaceutical drugs
 Clothings etc for millions of Southern Sudanese refugees who have been impoverished
 battered and displaced by years of Civil war in our lands.
 I am therefore using this medium to solicit for your assistance. Your contacts were obtained  by me during my search on the Internet for a reliable person that would assist us in claiming this money from the Secret Vault of a Financial Institution where it was deposited in a friendly Country  through the help of a sympathetic Senior Nurse attached to the Red Cross International Society some time ago
 though the Nurse is late now as she died of Typhoid fever shortly after but there is a particular Financial Agent who would assist you in  claiming the money and using part of it to buy foods
 pharmaceutical drugs
 Clothing etc for millions of Southern Sudanese refugees.
 I would send copy of a POWER OF ATTORNEY given to me by the Late Commander which I would send alongside copies of my INTERNATIONAL PASSPORT and a second Power of Attorney to you that would enable you claim the funds from the Financial Institution upon your agreement and readiness to assist us.
 I wish to repeat here and also wish to remind you of the TOP SECRECY this transaction requires
 as I expect your positive response through this above Email address as my movement is presently restricted by law covering Political Refugees
 though I might give you a telephone number later where you can talk with me. On receiving your positive response we hope to finish this transaction within one week as a lot of our people are dying from sicknesses
 diseases and hunger.
 Expecting  your URGENT Positive response and thanks in advance.
 Yours  Sincerely

 Waleed Abdalla Ibrahim Mohamed
 P/S. If you are not interested in assisting us
 we beg you to destroy this letter so that it does not fall into wrong hands.

I am so sorry for sending you this unsolicited and unexpected mail. I got your contact from a Business directory in my agents office and I decided to contact you directly for the sake of business. My full Name is Francis Williams.I am searching for a reliable and experience business partner.
 I have about $4.3 Million Dollars with me and I would want to develop it and then invest it here in U.A.E or Europe under your guidance. So I am only soliciting for your assistance to help me develop the currency. My Business is totally free of risk and trouble.
 If you are willing to invest in this business please give me your confidential contact phone number so that we can see face to face and discuss in details.

Dear friend

 My name is Barrister Paul BENSON the attorney of late Thompson Morris a
 Citizen of United States of America who deposited the sum of
 $4.8million US Dollars cash in a DIPLOMATIC SECURITY COMPANY in Europe
 I Requested for the release of his funds few months ago before i fell
 Sick and also to be transfer to any of his family member/cousin or
 Relation which will be you.
 The problem that am having at the moment is getting a reliable and
 trusted person that will forward   his contact and also
 his full name and Identification then i will proceed by Sending a POWER
 of ATTORNEY to him and a release letter that will direct the Diplomatic
 Security Company to deliver the funds to you either by cash or by Bank
 Transfer due to the fact that the funds are deposited in cash. I have
 all the documents that prove that the money is not a DRUG money and
 also CERTIFICATE OF ANTI-TERRORISE and MONEY LAUDERING.
 If you can play the role by sending me your details such as follow:

Dear Friend.
 "    I am Rev. Fr.Richard David. A senior staff with the World Bank fact finding &amp; special duties office.I am writing you this letter based on the fact that cool penny is better than millions of dollars means its better for one to live and die poor honest man than a rich dishonest one."
 I and the Chief security officer (CSO) of this organization and have arranged with an officer in the computer section in person of Engineer Joseph Cliff to bring out part of your total pending payment with reference number (LEM-05-371) amounting to US$10 million. Why we did this is because according to information gathered from the Bank’s/security computer
 you have been waiting for a long time to receive this payment without success.
 As I found out that you have almost met all the statutory requirements in respect of your pending payment. The problem we feel you are having is that of interest groups. A lot of people are interested in your payment and those people are merely doing paper works with you and that explains why you receive different kinds of untrue fax and phone messages from different people everyday.
 Also we found out that some of the officials of the prostates have been extorting a lot of money from you with the pretext of helping you receive your money. I can assure you this will keep happening if you do not do away with those officers. For security reasons you do not have to tell anybody that your have your payment on the way until the payment gets to you.
 The said payment is been arranged in a security-proof box weighing 75kg. In order to get this box shipped to you I and the (COS) Yesterday went to this four courier companies DHL
 Ems
 FedEx and Ups to make arrangements on how to get the box shipped to you by courier
 but to no avail the above courier companies all made us to understand that they  have to open the box for inspection by the customs before shipment.
 This is something we want to avoid because this box is been padded with synthetic nylon and to open it you will have to cut the pad before you will meet the button that you will press to open the dial code-lock. There is no way you can open the box and be able to close it again because it was padded with machine.
 We told the courier services that the box contained film materials and when open will spoil the materials. &lt;N:B&gt; we did not declare money because courier does not carry money.Today a friend of mine who is diplomat disclosed to me that there is a security courier service company that is specialized in sending diplomatic materials and information from one country to another
 which also has diplomatic immunity and consignment such as this cannot be checked by any customs anywhere in the world.
 I have therefore met the official of the security courier service and concluded shipping arrangement with them
 which they will commence as soon as I have your go ahead order. The diplomat who will be bring in this consignment to you is an expact and has been in this line of work for many years now so we have Notting to worry about.
 After all arrangements we have concluded that you must donate Five Hundred Thousand United States dollars (US$500
000.00) to any charity organization I designate as soon as you receive your money. To this effect
 you will send to us a promissory note for the donation along with your address where you will like the box to be delivered to by courier.
 Please maintain topmost secrecy as it may cause a lot of problems if found out that we are using this way to help you. You are advised not inform anyone about this until you received your money. Am helping you on this because something in me is tells me that you are an honest person. When you conclude this and you send our promise
 we will help to ship the final part of your money to you.May God be with you as i wait for your response either through Fax or Email:

Manager National Bank of Dubai Abu Dhabi
 Email;mr_mustaphasalleh@yahoo.com
 Dear

 I am Mr. Mustapha Salleh Manager National Bank of Dubai Abu Dhabi branch
 I have urgent and very confidential business proposition foryou. A British Oil consultant and contractor with the Kruger Gold Company
 Mr. Raymond Beck made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months
 valued at US$25m (Twenty Five Million United States American Dollars). in my branch.
 Upon maturity
I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.After a month
 we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers
 the Kruger Gold Company that Mr. Raymond Beck died in a plane crash along with his wife Mr. and Mrs. Raymond Beck died in a plan crash along with his wife in Egypt Air Flight 990
1999 air
 crash (for more information about this crash and person you can contact this website&lt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm&gt;
 Since we got this information about his death and on further investigation
 I found out that he died without making a WILL
 and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Raymond Beck did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents
 including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.
 This sum of US$25m (Twenty Five Million United States American Dollars).is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of United Arab Emirates
 at the expiration of 7 (seven) years
 the money will revert to the ownership of the (U.A.E) Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.
 "Consequently
 my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Raymond Beck so that the fruits of this old mans labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple
 I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin."
 We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paper work for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested
 please reply immediately via the private email address above.
 Upon your response
 I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. Please observe utmost confidentiality
 and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.
 Awaiting your urgent reply.
 Regards.

Dear Friend

 the Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.
 He has disclose to me a personal savings which he has managed to put
 together to run the up coming election before his sudden stroke of 4th
 January 2006.
 Following the significant stroke suffered by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon
 in January 2006
 a decision was reached by the Israeli Cabinet
 under the
 advice of the Attorney General of Israel: if the Prime Minister becomes
 incapable of making decisions
 power is transferred to the Deputy Prime
 Minister until the Prime Minister recovers. If the Prime Minister is
 declared permanently incapacitated then the Acting Prime Minister remains
 in office for 100 days. Once that period expires the President of Israel
 oversees the process of assembling a new governing coalition If the Prime
 Minister dies the Cabinet chooses a new Prime Minister. In this case
Ehud
 Olmert is now the new prime minister.
 The possibilities that Ariel Sharon will come back to that position is not
 cancelled. He gave me the order to look for a reliable personnel of your
 caliber to assist him in re-profiling a certain amount of funds which is
 undisclosed at the moment before he into coma.As soon as I get your
 willingness and confidentiality to forge ahead in executing  this
 transaction
 I will let you into confidential information on how to
 execute the transaction. Meanwhile
 Be aware that the percentage sharing
 used for any expenses  we may incurred in the process of transferring the
 cooperation in finalizing with this transaction swiftly.Your response

I am Mr MAXWELL TAMBO
 Bank Manager of a Reputable bank in Johannesburg
 Gauteng Province
 and Republic of South Africa. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.On feb 27
 2001
 a British Oil Consultant/contractor with the South African Mining Corporation
 (Name deliberately with held) made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months
 valued at US$50
000
000.00 (Ffity Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity
 I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.
 "After a month
 we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers
 the South African Mining Corporation
 that the depositor died from an automobile accident. On further investigation
 I found out that he died without making a WILL
 and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that  the depositor did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents
US$50
00
000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of Republic of South Africa
at the expiration of 5(five) years
 the money will revert to the ownership of the South African Government if nobody applies to claim the  fund.Consequently
 my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as THE NEXT OF KIN to the depositor so that the fruits of this old mans labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials."
 This is simple
 I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the Necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarisation of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favour for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60%for me and 35% for you and 5% for any expenses that we are going to incue.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested
 please reply immediately via the private email address.Upon your response
 I shall then  provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.
 Please send me your full name
address
 confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication.Also
Please observe utmost confidentiality
 and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.
 Thanks and Regards.

 because
 I believe everyone will die someday. My name is Razaq Samiu
 a merchant in Dubai
 in the "
 U.A.E. I have been diagnosed with prostate and esophageal Cancer that was discovered very late due to my laxity in caring for my health. It has 
 defiled all form of medicine and right now
 I have only about a few months to live according to medical experts. 
 I have not particularly lived my life so well
 as I never really cared for anyone not even myself but my business. Though I am very rich
 I was never generous
 I was always hostile to people and only focus on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know 
 that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this 
 world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that I know my time is near
 I have willed and given most of my properties 
 and assets to my immediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends and Schools in the UAE. I have decided to give alms to charity organizations
 as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far
 I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E
 
 England and Ireland. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly
 I cannot do this my self any more. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and donate the money
 which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria
 they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence
 I do not trust them anymore
 as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which is the huge cash that I deposit in a bank in England Uk.
 I want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations and let them know that it is I Razaq Samiu that is making this generous donation. 
 I am writing this from my laptop computer in my hospital bed in England where I wait for my time to come. If you are interested to help me i will give you more information about this like the amount that i deposited in the bank and Contact of the bank so you can contcat them. I will also send you a picture of my self when i am on my laptop in the hospital. 
 Note that you will take 20% out of the funds and give 80% to the charity organizations. I pray that God uses you to support and assist me with good heart God be with you.

  I will like to put a proposal to you. i am not by in any way compelling you.Brief information about myself.
 I am the only Daughter of my late parents Mr.and Mrs.rich. My father was a highly reputable busnness magnet who operated in the capital of Ivory coast during his days.
 It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad on the 12th September 2004. Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of
 his who travelled with him at that time. But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 6yrs old
 and since then my father took me so special. 
 Before his death on September 2004
 he called me and informed me that he has the sum of Nine Million
 Seven Hundred thousand United State
 Dollars.(USD$9
700
000.00)left in fixed deposit account in one of the leading banks in Africa. He further told me that he
  deposited the money in my name
 and also gave me all the necessary but legal documents to this fund with the bank.
 "I am just\xa020 years old and a university undergraduate and really dont know what to do. Now I want an account overseas where I can transfer this funds and after the transaction I will come and reside permanently in your country till such a time that it will be convinient for me to return back home if I so desire. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of incessant"
 political crisis here in Ivory coast. The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life. I also want to invest the fund under your care because I am ignorant of business world.
 I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards. Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded. Now permit me to ask these few questions:
 1. Can you honestly help me from your heart?
 2. Can I completely trust you?
 3. What percentage of
  the total amount in question
 will be good for you after the money is in your
 account? 
 Please
 consider this and get back to me as soon as possible. Immedaitely I confirm your willingness
 I will also inform you more details involved in this matter.

 Good a thing to write you
which however is not mandatory nor will in any manner compel you to honour against your will.
 Dearest we are Gordon and Rose Wiliams 
of our late Parents Mr and mrs Victor Williams. Our Father was a highly reputable business magnet-(a cocoa merchant)who operated in the capital of Lagos during His days. 
 It is sad to say that He passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad.
 Though His sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been  masterminded by an uncle of ours who travelled with Him at that time. But God knows the truth!Our mother died when we where small 
and since then our Father took us so special.
 Before His death
 My father called me and told  me that he has the sum of (USD$12.500
000) ( MILLION UNITED STATES  DOLLARS )deposited with an international bank in Republic Nigeria  west Africa. He further told me that He deposited the money with the name  of a business partner while I am the next of kin to the deposited money.
 &gt;From Gordon and Rose
 We are just young 16 and 18 years old and a high school college people
 with  little knowledge of business that is why We are in need of a partner whom  will assist us to get this fund released for investments in his or her country while I proceed with our education

 Dear

 We are in a sincere desire of your humble assistance on this regard
 and your suggestions and ideas will be highly appreciated.
 Now permit me to ask these few questions?
 1. Can you honestly do this transaction with Us ?
 2.can We completely trust you?
 Please
Consider this and get back to us as soon as possible so that we can give you the full informations that will be need. And We will want you to know that you are the frist person we have contacted for this transaction.
 Thank you so much and God bless you abundantly.

 father
 sister 
 brother or any relative
 in the mist of strangers with a diffrent language that I dont understand
 imaging how painful it is being a cancer patient."
 There is absolutely going to be a great doubt and distrust in your heart in respect of this mail
coupled with the fact that so many individual have taken possession of internet to facilate their nefariouse deeds
thereby making it extremely difficult for genuine and legitimate business class persons to get attention and recognition.\xa0 
 I am Mrs. Alimatu Branco. I am Married to Mr. David Branco
 who worked with our Embassy in Spain for nine years before he died in the year 2002. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days.
 Before his death we were both born again
  Christian. Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $18.5 Million with a Bank in Benin Republic Presently this money is still in the custody of the Bank in Benin.
 Recently
 my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next Eight months due to cancer problem
 but I know that my doctor is not God. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to a Church
 Organisation or good person that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein. I want a Church
 Organisation or good person that will use this fund for Orphanages
 Widows and other peoples that needs help and also propagating the word of God and to endeavor that the house of God is maintained.
 The Bible made us to understand that "Blessed is the hand that giveth " I took this decision because I don\t have any child that will inherit this money
 " and my husband relatives are not Christians not even good at all because they are the one that are responsible for the death of my husband in other to have all my late husband properties and\xa0 i dont want my husbands effort to be used by those that conspired for his death. "
 This is why I am taking this decision
 I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bossom of the Lord. Exodus 14\xa0\xa0 Vs 14\xa0 says\xa0 that\xa0 "the Lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace". I don’t need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health hence the presence of my husband\s relatives are around me always. I don\t want them to know about this development and I know that with God all things are possible to those who trust in Him.
 As soon as I received your reply I shall give you the contact of the Bank in Benin. I will also issue a letter of authorization to the bank that will prove
  you the present beneficiary of this money. I also want you
 Church or Organization to always pray for me because the Lord is my only Shephard. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve Him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayer f ul l through your life. Contact me on this email address and any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing another good person
 church or organization for this same purpose.
 Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein.
 Hoping to receive your response immediately

Dear Sir

        It is my pleasure to write this mail to you and to say thanks for your effort in providing an opportunity to read my mail. I got your contact when i was making some searches in the internet.
 My name is Mrs Atiya Mohameed
 a Liberian. I was until recently the wife of Mr. Ibrahim Mohameed  who was the chief army officer to my country Libera. I am contacting you  to seek your co-operation in investing $USD10.M in your company or your country
s economy.
 My  husband made this money when he was on sit as the commander and chief army officer while  Charles Taylor is the president  of Liberia.
 Due to some religious and political problems 
 my husband was  hijacked and brutally assasainated by the rebel leathers in Liberia.
 "It is worthy to note that during my husbands life time he used his position as a former chief aid to must have made this money in question."
 "This money was realised from  the sales of gold and diamond 
which are the countrys major resources and sources of income.And before his death 
my husband was able to send this money via a Ghanian diplomatic contact to the country 
where it is currently secured with a security company as a FAMILY  TREASURE"
  and  my name was used as the depositor in view of my husband
s position as an insider in the government.
 And it was my husband
s refusal to realise the money to former President Charles Taylor that resulted in the killing in February 2003.
 Now 
 that i have passed through the mourning ordeal for my husband  I am   thinking and planning the next step to take with respect to how  and where  to invest the money.
 "So my aim of sending this mail to you is to solicit your assistance in transfering this money to your country where it could be invested in a viable business for our mutual benefit. I am ready to enter into a joint venture with your company or we can open a new company with the money because im sure the money inside the box can establish a company of any type."
 I want to assure you that you will be highly rewarded for your assistance both in cash or in the joint venture.
 Please reply to this mail
 indicating your ability to handle this transaction so that i will give you details to enable us map out strategies for the implementation of this project.
 Best regards

I am Amina Idris from the State of Kassala in the Eastern part of Sudan. I recently lost my husband who until his death was a serving officer with the SPLA here in Sudan. He died in the cause of performing his duties under the United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS).
 Before his death he was privileged to have served close the powers that be in my country and this exposed him to huge sums of money of which about $7.5 Million was left to my surviving son and I.
 I am contacting you because I need a big favor from you as regards receiving these funds on our behalf and help us invest it in a profitable venture. Due to my inexperience in matters of business
 I am willing to give free rein of affairs to you in the day to day running of such a business venture.

 I am Mrs.Shade lbrahim the Wife of late Dr. Al-bahadili lbrahim from Trikit in northern
 Iraq
 
My late husband was the former Director General of North Oil Company Ltd ( NOC ) www.noc-iraq.com located in ( KIRKUK ) northern city of Iraq during Sadam Hussain regime before the United State invassion of Iraq

 He was captured and assasinated recently by shiite militants led by Moqtada Al-Sadr in the recent secterian killing that is going on in Iraq between Majority Shiites and Minority Sunis
 Before his death he was able to confirm to us of an existence deposit of US$11
000
000.00 ( Eleven Million US DOLLARS ) which he secretly deposited cash in oversea Depository and finance security vault as a consignment through a diplonatic personel in Thailand for safekeeping .
 Presently I am Temporary living a political exile life here in Chiang Rai
 Thailand therefor being under the protection of the United Nation High Commission on Refugee because our life in Iraq are no more gurranteed by the recent Iraq government due to daily killing of all top Suni important personalites

 For the above reason I decided to ask for an assistance and help from you as a foreign partner to enable us reach a long term investment partnership agreement under joint venture partnership to transfer this fund to your bank account in your country for investment purpose.

 DR. BISI OMOYENI
 MANAGING DIRECTOR/CHIEF EXECUTIVE (WBN).

It is by the grace of God that I received Christ
knowing the truth and the truth have set me free.Having known the truth
 I had no choice than to do what is lawful and right in the sight of God for eternal life and in the sight of man for witness of God?s mercy and glory upon my life. I have the pleasure to share my testimony with you
 having seen your contact from the Internet.
 I am Barrister Martinez Obe
 the legal adviser to late Mr.and Mrs.Grieves Martins a British couple that lived in my Country Nigeria for 25 years before they died in the Bellview plane crash . They are good Christian
 They so dedicated to God but They had no child till they died. 
 Throughout their stay in my country
 They acquired a lot of properties like lands
 house properties
 etc. As their legal adviser
 before their death
 They instructed me to write their WILL. Because they had no child
 They dedicated their wealth to God. According to the WILL
 the properties have to be sold and the money be given out to a ministry for the work of God
 Orphanages and less privilegdes ones. As Their legal adviser
 all the documents for the properties were in my care.
 They gave me the authority to sell the properties and give out the fund to the Ministries for the work of God. 
 In short
 I sold all the properties after their death
 as they instructed And as matter of fact
 after I sold all their properties
 I realized more than $10
000
000.00 (Ten million US dollars plus)
and what supposed to be the percentage interest of my right legal fee was firstly deducted by me out of the total amount realized from the sold properties
 this was base on the initial agreement between me and the owner of the properties before their death. 
 "Therefore the total amount left to be invested into Gods work as instructed by the owner
 is $10
000
000.00 (Ten million US dollars) only. But Instead of giving the main fund out for the work of God as instructed to me by the owner before their death. "
 I converted the fund to myself with the intention of investing the fund abroad for my personal use. I was afraid of putting the fund in the Bank
 because I have to give account to the bank on how I got the money. I then packaged the fund in consignments and deposited the consignments with a security company. I did not want the management of the Security Company to know the content of the consignments; therefore I registered the content of the consignments as Gold Bars. Now
 the security company believes that what I deposited with them was Gold Bars. 
 I had encounter with Christ when Rev. Billy Graham was preaching on television concerning Ananias and Saphira in Acts 5:1-11. After hearing the word of God
 I gave my life to Christ and became a born again Christian. As a born again Christian
 I started reading my bible and one day
 the Lord opened my eyes to Ezekiel 33: 18 and 19 where the word of God says: "When the righteous truth from his righteousness
 and committee iniquity
 he shall even die thereby. But if the wicked turn from his wickedness
 and do that which is lawful and right
 he shall live thereby". From the scripture
 I discovered that the only way I could have peace in my life is to do what is lawful and right by giving out the fund as instructed for the work of God by the owner before her death. 
 "I have asked God for forgiveness and I know that God have forgiven me. But I have to do what is lawful and right in the sight of God by giving out the fund to the chosen ministry for the purpose of Gods work as instructed by the owner before her death. After my fasting and prayers
 I asked God to make his choice and direct me to a honest Christian but after my fervent prayer over it
 then you were nominated to me through divine revelation from God
 so these are how I received such a divine revelation from the Lord
 how I got your contact information
 and I then decided to contact you for the fund to be used wisely for things that will glorify the name of God. "
 I have notified the Security Company where I deposited the consignments that contained the fund
 that I am moving the consignment abroad and the security company has since been waiting for my authority for the consignment to leave my country and move to abroad. You should also forward to me your telephone and fax number for easy communication and to fax you the documents concerning the consignments. 
 prompt response will be highly appreciated.you can contact me on my secured e-mail address martinezobe84@keromail.com 
 Yours in Christ

 My Dear Beloved

      Let me start by introducing myself. I am  Mr. Maekal Mekha
 a Baghdad Citizen
 Iraq
 a Mechant as an occupation. I have a obscured business suggestion for you. I am a brother to Dr.Gerald Mekha
who worked with 
 Iraq Judicial Commission 
 Iraq
 for over a decade before he died on 20th of March in the year 2007.
 He died after a brief  illness that lasted for two weeks. Before his death he made a vow to use his wealth for the down trodden and the less privileged in the society. When my brother was alive he deposited the sum of £250 Million Pounds (Two Hundred and Fifty Million Pounds) with one United Kingdom Security Company in London.
 This funds are still with the Security Company for the past 6 years now
the funds are locked in two metallic trunk boxes
 deposited with these company
 i am in a refugee camp here in Iraq
 as a result of the war in 
 Iraq this moment
 am sorry am not too fine based on my health
though what disturbs me most is my stroke. 
 "Having known my condition and want to make sure i do my fathers will
 I have decided to donate this fund to an individual or company
that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein. "
 "I want an individual or company that will use this to fund and provide succor to poor and indigent persons
 orphanages
 and widows and for propagating peace in the universe. I understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I do not have any one that will inherit this money and my staying in the refugee camp
 still dont know when ill be granted the visa permit out of Iraq. I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner
 hence the reason for taking this bold decision."
 I do not need any telephone communication in this regard because of my uneasy access to the facility in the refugee camp here in Iraq. Also because of the presence of social security in the camp
 I do not want them to know. With Allah all things are possible.
  As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact information of the Security Company in London
United Kingdom. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will empower you as the original beneficiary of this fund. I want you to always pray for me.
 My happiness is that I lived a life worthy of emulation. Whosoever that wants to serve the Almighty Allah must serve him with all his heart and mind and soul and also in truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for an individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act according to my specification herein. 
 Hoping to hear from you. Thank you and may the Almighty Allah bless you.

    Here writes Mrs Mary Parker
 suffering from esophageal cancer. I am married to Mr. Robert Parker an Englishman who is dead. My late husband died with a deposit of £ 17.5 Million Seventeen Million Five Hundred Thousand Pounds) with his bank here in UK derived from his vast estates and investment in capital market . Before his death we both got born-again and dedicated Christians. 
 Recently
 my Doctor told me that I have limited days to live due to the cancerous problems I am suffering from. Though what bothers me most is the stroke that I have in addition to the cancer. Recently
 the Bank management just wrote me as the beneficiary that our account has been DORMANT and if I
 as the beneficiary of the funds
 do not re-activate the account; the funds will be CONFISCATED or I rather issue a letter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf as I can not come over. And doctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to live. So it is my last wish to have a God-fearing person use this money to fund churches
 orphanages and widows propagating the word of God. I took this decision because I do not have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are bourgeois and very wealthy persons. And I do not want my husband hard earned money to be used in an unGodly manner by unbelievers in God. You can contact me through my personal email address: maryparker_0022@yahoo.co.uk

 ATTENTION:
 ICEP is charged with the responsibility of finding bank accounts in Switzerland belonging to non-Swiss indigenes
 which have remained dormant since World War II. 
 The continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP)have since resulted in the discovery of additional dormant accounts -54 
000 in December
 1999.
 The published lists contain all types of dormant
 accounts
including interest-bearing savings accounts

 securities accounts
 safe deposit boxes
 custody accounts
 and non-interest-bearing transaction accounts.
 Numbered accounts are also included.Interest is
 paid on accounts that were interest bearing when established.
 The Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of all claims on accounts due non-Swiss citizens.
 A dormant account of Hami Ramzy with a credit balance of 15
800
000 US dollar plus accumulated interest was discovered by me.
 The beneficiary was murdered during the holocaust era
 leaving no WILL and no possible records for trace of theirs.
 The Claims Resolution Tribunal has been mandated to report all unclaimed funds for permanent closure of accounts and transfer of existing credit balance into the treasury of
 Switzerland government as provided by the law for management of assets of deceased benefi ciaries who died interstate living no wills).
 All that is required is for you to provide me with your details for processing of the necessary legal and administrative claim documents for transfer of the funds to you.
 THERE IS NO RISK INVOLVED
 The Holocaust Claims Processing Office has put funds in Escrow awaiting
 submission of valid claims for necessary disbursement
 I find myself privileged to have this information and this may be a great opportunity for a life time of success without risks.
 Thanking you in anticipation for your prompt response.

Hello

 I write to solicit your assistance in a funds transfer deal involving US$ 3.5M.This fund has been stashed out of the excess profit made last year by this branch of the International Commercial Bank which I am the manager. I have already submitted an approved end of the year report for the year 2005 to my head office here in Accra-Ghana and they will never know of this excess. I have since then
 placed this amount on a Non-Investment Account without a beneficiary.
 Upon your response
 I will configure your name on our database as holder of the Non-Investment Account. I will then guide you on how to apply to my head office for the Account Closure/ bank-to-bank remittance of the funds to your designated bank account.
 If you concur with this proposal
 I intend for you to retain 30% of the funds while 70% shall be for me.
 Kindly forward your response to: toneyak05@yahoo.es

Dearest Beloved

 Please kindly go through this letter before you pass judgment because I am in\xa0 need of assistance from a God fearing and trustworthy person. I am Mr. Sayid Mustafa the son of late Dr. Malik Mustafa\xa0 from Sierra Leone. I must confess my agitation is real
 and my words is my bond
 in this 
 proposal
 My late father happens to be in control of a large number of farms including cattle’s and many sheep\xa0before he was poisoned by his foreign business partners in Paris with my mother in one of their farmers association meeting because of greed. 
 But before his death my late father deposited some amount of money outside our country in a\xa0bank at the tone of Four Million United States Dollars $4
000.000.00. So I and my little sister\xa0were no longer safe here as the present government of\xa0 Sierra Leone are working with almost all the 
 killers of my late father and were looking a way to\xa0kill us too\xa0as one of them has\xa0 just been made a minister
 name undisclosed because of security reasons.
 "Furthermore we have contacted the bank where the money\xa0was deposited and the bankers let us understand that they signed an agreement with our late father that the total money must be transferred into his foreign business partner account undisclosed to them 
therefore because of this reason the money will not be released to us until the foriegn partner of my late father comes for the claim of the money or we should present to them the partner of our late father and that is the major reason why i am contacting you now for assistance so that you can contact the bank as my late fathers foriegn partner."
 All\xa0i need\xa0\xa0from you now\xa0 if you have accepted\xa0 and willing to help us \xa0when replying is your full names and address including your direct and personal telephone number for easy communication as you know that this transaction is a very confidential one and also assure me that you are really ready to assist us.
 Please Kindly get back to me immediately after you must have gone through my message fill free and make it urgent because we are in a very difficult situation now.\xa0 I am\xa0offering you 15 % of the total money amount
 if you accept to help us transfer this money\xa0and in case of any necessary expenses you might incur during this transaction.
 N.B Try and negotiate for me some profitable blue chip investment opportunities which is risky free which I can invest with this money when it is transferred from the bank here
 personally I am interested in estate management and hotel business
 please advise me.
 For more explanation and convinction from me please\xa0write me through my 
 \xa0Please note that this is a very important\xa0 to us\xa0and if really you will like to help us in this transaction we plead\xa0that you help us with your heart and sincerity and\xa0promise me and\xa0 my younger sister to be a good guardian considering our situation and not to betray us because we believed that Good people still exist..
 We are really hoping to hear from you soonest and it will be our greatest joy to know that you have accepted and willing to handle this transaction till the end.
 Thanks and God bless you and your family.

 Abidjan
 My Name is Miriam; I worked as a maid to Mr. ROBERT BUTLER an American
 who used to be a contractor with an oil servicing company based here in Cote D’Ivoire. Last year
{Jan. 2006} my master died of a serious illness
 but before his death
 he told me in confidence of a fund of Twenty Seven Million dollars (US$27
000
000.00) which he concealed in two trunk boxes and\xa0 deposited with a finance House in Cote D’Ivoire. However
 the Finance house does not know the true content of the trunk to be cash as my Master declared upon deposit as containing art craft for export.
 Because of the fast deteriorating state of his health
 he was afraid that he might die loosing all he has in a foreign country. He instructed me that if he dies
 I should try everything within my capability to make sure that his fund at the safe keeping house gets into the hands of the less privileged in his home country and he handed over the documents of this deposit to me with a written instruction. 
 "I have contacted the finance house over this issue
 but they refused to release the trunk Boxes to me
 unless I bring any of Mr. ROBERT BUTLERS relatives. This is a very tough situation for me
 because since I lived with my master
 he has not mentioned any of his family or extended relatives and Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over a year now
 I seek your consent to present you to the finance house as an extended relative of my master so that the trunk boxes can be released to you and you will use some part of the money inside for the good purpose of my master while the both of us share the remaining."
 If you can handle this with me
 kindly respond back immediately and we will negotiate on what will be given to you for your kind effort.
 Thanking you for your cooperation.

I apologies to take your value time to introduce this business proposal to you which I imagine will be of utmost benefit to us. I am the first and only son of the late environmental activist
 a writer /publisher and a business man Chief Ken Saro Wiwa of the Ogoni land an oil producing community in the Niger Delta area of Nigeria
 President and founder of Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP)
 a non-violent action group.
 My father died by hanging during the military regime of president General Sani Abacha (deceased) as my father was fighting for the right of his of people Ogoni land to have resource control over their resources but the government was so brutal until the gang up to kill my father .
 "Actually my father knew he was going to die due to the ugly situation since the government was against him. Prior to his untimely death
 he wrote his Will that stated clearly that all his stocks /bonds
 property and fund belongs to me. My father personal legal advisor Mr. Briggs conspired with the government to confiscate some of my fathers fixed assets and frozen some of his account they were able to trace."
 Right now
 am seeking assistance from you to inherit the stocks and bonds
 property and fund on my behalf and use it to set up a good investment for me in nearest future which I believe the dividend will be great. My father deposited the some of US$34.Million in a private security company somewhere in Europe which I have all the paper work as proof of ownership in my custody and no one else knows about this accept my mother.
 After serving under the immediate past government of former president Olusegun Obasanjo as a minister in his cabinet. I am currently now undergoing a pastoral course in school of divinity. If you are sincerely interested and willing to help me in claiming this fund at the finance house in Europe and also capable handling a business of this magnitude kindly as a matter of urgency write me only through this email address: ken_sorowiwajr@excite.com and to know more about my father please

 Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over last 7 years now
 I will seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased since you have the same last names
 so that the proceeds of this account valued at ($16million US dollars) can be paid to you and then you and I can share the money.
 All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through.I guarantee that this will be executed under all legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.

 THOUSAND DOLLARS)
 I want to transfer to overseas the sum of ($8.500.000.00USD) Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) from a Prime Bank in Africa. I would like to ask you to quietly look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this money
 even an empty\xa0 a/c can serve as far as it can receive money.
 I am DR AHMED SHALAA. an accountant and personal confidant to Mr.Robert Rice who died together with his wife in a plane crash on the October 31st 1999 on their way to attendwedding in Boston
 he is an American
 a physician andindustrialist
 he died without having anybeneficiary to his assets including his account here in Burkina Faso which he opened as his personal savings for the purpose of expansion and developement of his company before his untimely death in 1999.
 "The amount involved is ($8.500.000.00USD) Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars)
 no other person knows about this account. I am contacting you for us to transfer this funds to your account as the beneficiary
 I want to transfer the whole $8
500.000.00 (Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand USD)\xa0 into a safe account abroad
 but I dont know any foreigner. I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local person here
 without valid international foreign passport
 but can only be approved to any foreigner with valid international passport or drivers license and foreign a/c because the money is in US Dollars and the former owner of the a/c Mr.Robert Rice is aforeigner too
 and as such the money can only be approved into a foreign a/c."
 I need your full co-operation to make this work fine because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account
 which I will give to you
 upon your positive response and once I am convinced that you are capable and will meet up with the inheritance procedures.
 At the conclusion of this business
 you will be given 40% of the total amount
55% will be for me
 while 5% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during the process of transferring. You should observe utmost CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECRECY in this transaction
 and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I will require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

 as he has no family member that has any knowledge as to the existence of either the account or the funds; I have confidently discussed this issue with some of the bank officials and we have agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal with.
 My proposition to you
 is to seek your consent to present you as the Next of kin and beneficiary of this late client
 So that the proceeds of this account valued a huge sum shall be paid to you
 and then we can share the amount on a mutually agreed percentage of 30% for you
While 60% for me and others involved
 10% shall be used for miscelenious expenses while the remainder shall be given to a reputable charity home because the money is owned by a deceased person.
 This transaction is totally free of risk and troubles as the fund is legitimate and does not originate from drug
 money laundry
 terrorism or any other illegal act
 funds will be released to you after necessary processes have been followed. Let me hear from you as soon as you get this message
 so we can proceed. You can respond using email address <a shape="rect" href="mailto:mrleonprivate@babbalu.com">mrleonprivate@babbalu.com</a>

Dear Friend
 "I am Sir John Kempwelch one of the Director of HSBC Bank
 London
 United Kingdom. On the 2nd of January 2005
 I received a call that one of my customer died in the Tsunami Disaster with his wife and only child while on vacation at Phuket Island in Thailand. Since then I have made several enquiries to locate any of my customers extended relatives and until date have not succeeded. "
 I have contacted you to assist in repatriating the money left behind by my client before it gets confiscated by our bank or declared unserviceable by our bank where this deposit is lodged. 
 Now
 the bank Directors has called a board meeting regarding this Fund. So my main motive right now is to share this great opportunity with you by presenting you as the Next of Kin to the Deceased since all his banking details are with me as his personal Account Officer. And the deceased Account valued at US$17.5M
 Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the biological relatives of my late client
 I hereby seek your consent to present you to the bank as next-of-kin of the deceased since you are a foreigner
 so that the proceeds of this account valued at  US$17.5M can be transferred to you as inheritance and thereafter
 you and I can share the money; 50% to me and 40% to you
 while 10% will be donated to the Tsunami Disaster Charity Fund. 
 We shall start the first transfer with US$5
000.000.00 (Five Million United States Dollars only)
 upon the successful actualization of the first transfer without any disappointment from your side
 we shall re-apply for the payment of the remaining amount to your account. I have the original copy of Certificate of Deposit of the funds
 which will be used to substantiate our inheritance claims. All I require is your consent and honest co-operation to enable us see the deal through. 
 Furthermore
 I guarantee that the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please contact me if you are interested immediately via my personal email:jkpw1968@yahoo.co.uk to enable us commence on the transaction. 
 Best regards
 
 Sir John Kempwelch.

 by name Mr\xa0Basil
 who here in after shall be referred to as my client
 died as the result of a heart-related condition on the 11th November 2004. His heart condition was due to the death.
   I have contacted you to assist in distributing the money left behind by my client before it is confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank when this deposit valued at 4.5million dollars is lodged. This bank has issued me a notice to contact the next of kin
 or the account will be confiscated.
 My proposition to you is to seek your consent to present you as the next-of-kin and beneficiary of my named client
 since you have the same last name
 so that the proceeds of this account can be paid to you.
 " Then we can share the amount on a mutually agreed-upon percentage. All legal documents to back up your claim as my clients next-of-kin will be provided.All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see the transaction through."
 "This will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from many breach of the law If this business proposition offends your moral values

name of my bank and other important information if I receive a positive reply 
 from you. For security reasons I cannot disclose my full identity to you now 
 until I am sure of your cooperation. 
 I work in the operations dept where I serve as account officer to numerous
 customers. One of the customers whom I worked as his account officer was a 
 wealthy diamond merchant from Australia. Because this man was good to me when he 
 I could locate any of his close relations. On reaching there I discovered that 
 his only surviving uncle died a few months back. I sponsored this trip on my own 
 and nobody in the bank knew I was undertaking the journey so I did not present 
 any official report of my findings in the bank. Now there are two things I could 
 do with regards to the money. 
 First
 as his accounts officer
 I could formally notify the bank authorities 
 forfeited to the government after some time. As a matter of fact this is the 
 proper thing I am supposed to do. 
 Another thing I can do is to arrange for someone else
 a foreigner
 to act as 
 option that I can do to help anybody and myself since the money actually is 
 public fund due to the fact that my friend was a close ally to the late brutal 
 military president that looted government treasury. And that is why I have 
 the next of kin of the dead man and the whole money in the account will be 
 transferred to your account. As the accounts officer to the late man
 I have all 
 the necessary documents that will require claiming the money in the account.The
 total money in the account is USD25 million. Your share will be 30%

 Reach me immediately by email  so that I can give you further details. Also 
 provide me you with direct tel.number to reach you.

Hello

 "I am very sorry to embarrass you with this email as I did not mean to intrude in your privacy if not for the peculiar situation I have found myself. As you read this
 dont feel sorry for me
 because it is the destiny of everyman to die someday. I am Jaron Abbas an Israeli by birth and a business merchant based in Scotland. I have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer."
 It has defiled all forms of medical treatment
 and right now I have only about a few months to live
 according to medical experts. I regret that I have not particularly lived my life so well
 as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself)
 but my trade. Though I am very well to do
 I was never open handed; I was always hostile to people and regarded them like they never had hopes of becoming as successful as myself. Now I know that there is a lot more to life than just prosperity.
 I believe that when I am given a second chance to come to this world
 I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that death is imminent
 I have willed and given most of my belongings to immediate and extended family members
 as well as a few close friends. I want Allah to be merciful to me and accept my soul. Hence I have decided to support charity work; this is what I want to be remembered for. So far
 I have been able to reach out to a few charity organizations in the Singapore
 Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly
 I cannot do this myself anymore.
 I once asked members of my family to aid me in giving of alms to those organizations catering for the less privileged in Bulgaria and Pakistan; they refused and kept the resources to themselves. Hence
 I do not trust them anymore
 as they seem not to be contempt with what I have left for them.
 The last of my belonging which no one knows of
 is the huge deposit of Two Million
 Five Hundred Thousand US dollars that I have in a safe keeping company abroad
 which I will want you to secure and bestow to charity organizations.
 You can reach me on my email address jaron_abbass@yahoo.de
 Jaron Abbas

I am writing you this mail after several internal battles in me
 if i am doing the right thing
 as i have gotten your email ever since but i have been hesitating to write you.
 "I dont want you to feel sorry for me
 because
 I believe everyone will die someday. My name is K I Bakri 
 a widower and a former oil investor in Dubai
 in the U.A.E.I have been diagnosed with Ideopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis. This is a terminal illness that affects the lungs
 it has no cure and i am destined to leave this world any moment from now. I have not particularly lived my life so well
 as I never really cared for anyone(not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich
 I was never generous
 I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. "
 I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me
 I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so
 I have decided to give also to charity organizations
 as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far
 I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the Sudan
Indonesia
Norway
Netherland.
 Now that my health has deteriorated so badly
 I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in United States of America
 they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence
 I do not trust them anymore
 as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them.
 The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Eight Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars($8
500
000) that I have with a Security Company abroad. 
 What i want to do is to make you the next of Kin/Beneficiary of this diplomatic box kept with the security company and collect the money stashed in the diplomatic box 
 and thereafter distirbute the money to the less priviledged and hungry. MY health is failing and there is nothing much i can do towards achieving this last wish of mine
all by myself because of my bedridden state in the hospital.
 I have set aside 30% for your time
service and expenses.
 N.B:My beloved friend please if you can perform this task 
please do not hesitate to write me
telling me about your passion to help the less-fortunate.
 God be with you
